The innovative ‘Matir Srishti’ programme was launched in 2020 in the dry western (Paschimanchal) districts of the state. It was a worthy community initiative in the category of preservation of natural heritage and bio diversity, to make barren, non- arable, dry, mono- crop lands finally fertile and cultivable for growing multiple crops including horticulture and vegetable cultivation, said Hon’ble Chief Minister. She further informed that United Nations (FAO) also recognised West Bengal’s famous Gobindbhog, Tulaipianji and Kanakchur Aromatic rice as food & culture heritage. The UN-FAO recognition of the initiatives is a prestigious honour for globally recognised good works to conserve natural heritage, bio-diversity and food & culture heritage. She dedicated the recognition to the entire rural community, especially the farmers of West Bengal.",
