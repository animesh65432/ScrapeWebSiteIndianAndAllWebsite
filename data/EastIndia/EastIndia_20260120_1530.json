She extended her heartfelt congratulations to all the scientists involved in the work. Among these four new varieties, three—'Subhashini', 'Lachhmanti', and 'Musafir'—are suitable for drought-prone areas in the western part of the state, such as West Midnapore, Purulia, and Bankura, and are capable of yielding 52 to 55 quintals per hectare during the Kharif season. On the other hand, a variety named 'Iravati' was developed for the flood-prone areas of South Bengal, which did not perish even after prolonged submersion and did not fall over during storms, she added. Hon’ble Chief Minister said that, including those four, since 2011, the state government developed a total of 25 new crop varieties through research for the benefit of farmers of which 15 are rice varieties.",
