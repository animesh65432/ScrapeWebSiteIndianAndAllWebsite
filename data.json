        "content": "**Reference:** 288/2025-2026\n\n**Aizawl, the 2nd December, 2025:**Mizoram Governor General (Dr) Vijay Kumar Singh, PVSM, AVSM, YSM (Retd) attended the the North East Conclave held in New Delhi under the GeoSmart World Conference & Expo 2025 on tuesday.\n\nIn his address, Mizoram Governor General (Dr) Vijay Kumar Singh called for geospatial intelligence, unified platforms and climate-ready systems to drive sustainable development across the region. He reflected on how the Northeast had long remained a distant and less explored region, often forgotten because of its challenging terrain and limited connectivity. He highlighted that the last 11-12 years have marked a dramatic shift, with unprecedented efforts to bridge infrastructural gaps and integrate the region more closely with India's development trajectory. Illustrating the magnitude of progress, he shared the story of Mizoram's railway connectivity, a project launched in 2015 that has successfully brought the railway line to Aizawl which demonstrates the complexity of terrain and the determination driving transformative change. \"This kind of engineering achievement was unheard of earlier, and it reflects the commitment to ensure our Northeast never remains what it used to be,\" he said.\n\nGeneral (Dr) Vijay Kumar Singh emphasised Mizoram's unique position in India's national fabric-a region of extraordinary biodiversity, cultural richness, and strategic importance, yet shaped by fragile slopes, seismic vulnerability, and dispersed settlements. These very challenges, he said, underline why advanced geospatial and digital technologies must be embedded into every stage of planning.\n\nHe called geospatial intelligence a force multiplier for development, explaining how terrain-informed governance, remote sensing, digital twins and GIS-based modelling can guide everything from road alignments and service delivery to environmental protection and disaster preparedness. For a state like Mizoram, where linear settlements stretch along narrow hill ridges and ecological sensitivity is high, such tools are essential for safeguarding both livelihoods and landscapes.\n\nHe noted that the Northeast's climatic realities, frequent landslides, cloudbursts, long monsoon spells and high seismicity make predictive technology indispensable. With modern remote sensing satellites, Doppler radars, hydrological models and loT sensors, the region can forecast landslides up to 72 hours in advance, monitor river levels in real time, and issue early warnings that reach both citizens and security forces. \"Technology is no longer a luxury for the Northeast. It is the foundation of a climate-resilient future,\" he said.\n\nHe spotlighted the strategic significance of Mizoram's international borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar. He stressed that smart connectivity and secure border management-using drones, sensors, integrated surveillance and resilient communication systems are critical for combating illegal movements, enhancing disaster response, and supporting security personnel deployed in difficult terrain.\n\nHighlighting Mizoram's vast potential in agroforestry, bamboo processing, renewable energy, ecotourism, horticulture, and traditional crafts, he underscored how technology can catalyse sustainable economic growth. Precision agriculture, soil health mapping, yield prediction, and spatial planning, he said, can help reduce dependence on shifting cultivation and strengthen long-term ecological balance.\n\nHe concluded by outlining future pathways for the region, emphasising the need for a unified geospatial platform for the entire Northeast, a strong indigenous drone ecosystem, and large-scale skill development in GIS, remote sensing, Al-based terrain analytics, UAV operations, and climate modelling. He called for deeper civil-military collaboration, greater involvement of academia and startups, and motivation for youth to embrace technology-oriented careers. With characteristic warmth, he added that professionals from across India should spend time working in the Northeast \"a place where the air is clean, the skies are blue, and the possibilities are endless.\" He ended with a powerful message, \"Mizoram and the Northeast are not just regions of hills and valleys, they are lands of immense possibility. With wisdom, sensitivity and technological vision, we can build a future that is resilient, sustainable, secure and prosperous for generations to come.\"\n\nThe North East Conclave at GeoSmart World Conference & Expo 2025 brought the spotlight firmly on the wider North-Eastern region, underscoring how.technology-led development is reshaping one of India's most biodiverse and strategically significant geographies.\n\nAttachment"

Kadmat Island, known\nfor its natural beauty and vibrant community life, relies primarily on sea\ntransport, with helicopter services playing a vital role in meeting urgent needs\nsuch as medical evacuations, administrative travel, and delivery of essential\nsupplies. Given the operational limitations of the existing helipad, including\nspace constraints, safety concerns, and proximity to residential areas, there is\na critical need to relocate and upgrade the facility to meet evolving aviation\nsafety standards and growing community requirements.\n\nIn response to these needs, the Administration of Lakshadweep has proposed\nthe acquisition of approximately 7,000 square metres of land for the shifting\nand development of the helipad at Kadmat Island. The project aims to\nenhance operational safety, improve emergency evacuation capability,\nsupport controlled tourism growth, and strengthen the island's connectivity\nwith other islands and the mainland.\n\nThis Social Impact Assessment (SIA) Report has been prepared in accordance\nwith the provisions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land\nAcquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (RFCTLARR Act) and\ncorresponding Lakshadweep regulations. It assesses the potential social\nimpacts of the proposed land acquisition, documents stakeholder concerns\nand expectations, and recommends mitigation measures to ensure that the\nproject is implemented in an equitable, inclusive, and environmentally\nresponsible manner.\n\nThe findings of this report are based on a thorough review of land records, field\nsurveys, community consultations, and inputs from relevant institutions and\ndepartments. It is intended to serve as a foundation for transparent decision-\nmaking and participatory planning, ensuring that the proposed helipad at\nKadmat Island becomes a model for sustainable infrastructure development,\nimproved accessibility, and enhanced quality of life in India's island territories.\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT.

We would like to\nextend our special thanks to the Revenue Department and the Office of the\nDeputy Collector, Kadmat, for facilitating field visits, land verification, and\nstakeholder interactions, which were crucial in preparing a comprehensive\nand factual assessment.

Back ground of the Project and its details\n\nThe Union Territory of Lakshadweep comprises 36 small coral islands in the\nArabian Sea with a total land area of just 32.62 sq. km, of which only 10\nislands are inhabited. As per the 2011 Census, the total population is 64,473.\nThe islands are ecologically sensitive and geographically isolated, relying\non air and sea connectivity primarily via Cochin. The administration seeks to\nbalance infrastructure development with ecological conservation to\nenhance residents' quality of life and support sustainable tourism across the\nterritory.\n\nKadmat Island, part of the Union Territory of Lakshadweep, is a narrow coral\nisland located approximately 407 kilometres west of Kochi in the Arabian\nSea. It has a total land area of about 3.2 square kilometres, stretching\nroughly 9 kilometres in length with an average width of 550 metres. The\nisland is surrounded by a large lagoon on its western side, covering an area\nof nearly 25 square kilometres, which supports rich marine biodiversity and\ntraditional fishing activities. As per the 2011 Census, Kadmat has a\npopulation of around 5,400 residents, predominantly engaged in fishing,\ncoconut cultivation, and small-scale service activities. The island is known\nfor its scenic beaches, vibrant coral reefs, and limited but essential\ninfrastructure catering to local needs and controlled tourism.\n\nThe proposed project for the shifting and development of the helipad at\nKadmat Island is aimed at improving air connectivity, enhancing\nemergency response capabilities, and supporting the socio-economic\ndevelopment of the island. The existing helipad location faces operational\nconstraints and limitations in expansion, necessitating relocation to a more\nsuitable site. The new site has been identified after considering safety,\naccessibility, and minimal environmental disturbance. For this purpose, a\ntotal of 7,000 square metres of land is proposed to be acquired. The\nselected land parcel ensures adequate space for the construction of the\nhelipad, associated infrastructure, and safety buffer zones in compliance\nwith aviation norms. The improved facility is expected to facilitate regular\nhelicopter services, ensure timely medical evacuations, improve disaster\npreparedness, and promote sustainable tourism, thereby directly benefiting\nthe local population and overall development of Kadmat Island.\n\nThe Social Impact Assessment (SIA) confirms that while the project is widely\nrecognized as essential for public welfare, community consultations\nemphasized the importance of minimizing disruption to common use areas\nand ensuring cultural and ecological sensitivity. To mitigate any potential\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD. Page 1\n\n**Page 14**\n\nShifting & Development of Helipad\n\nconcerns, the SIA recommends limiting the land acquisition to the minimum\nrequired area, ensuring fair and timely compensation, and implementing\ninclusive employment and skill-building programs for local youth and\nwomen.\n\n2. Public Purpose\n\nThe acquisition of 7,000 square metres of 11 land parcels for the shifting and\ndevelopment of the helipad at Kadmat Island qualifies as a public purpose\nunder Section 2(1) of the RFCTLARR Act, 2013, as it is intended for\ninfrastructure and transportation facilities vital to the community. The\nproposed helipad will facilitate emergency medical evacuation, disaster\nmanagement, essential service delivery, and improved connectivity for the\nresidents of this geographically isolated island, thereby directly serving the\npublic interest.\n\n3. Alternative sites considered\n\nAlternative locations for the proposed helipad were examined; however,\nthey were found unsuitable due to constraints in land area, safety\nclearances, accessibility, and potential environmental impacts. The\nselected site, requiring 7,000 square metres, meets all operational, safety,\nand environmental criteria and is therefore considered the most feasible\nand appropriate location for the project.\n\n4. Location of site\n\nThe proposed site for the shifting and development of the helipad at\nKadmat Island is located in the southern side of island at approximate\ngeographic coordinates 11.1133°N and 72.4551°E. The total land area\nidentified for acquisition is approximately 7,000 square metres of privately-\nowned land, containing 54 coconut trees, and is directly accessible via an\nexisting concrete road. The location has been strategically chosen to\nprovide unobstructed approach and take-off paths, maintain a safe\ndistance from densely populated areas, and ensure operational safety\nwhile minimising environmental disturbance, thereby supporting the island's\nconnectivity, emergency response, and tourism facilitation in a sustainable\nmanner.\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT.

Socio-economic condition of affected families.\n\nDemographic and Educational Profile:\n\nThe affected families belong entirely to the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category\nand follow Islam as their religion. In total, 18 families comprising 140\nindividuals were surveyed. Of these, 74 were males and 66 were females,\nreflecting a male dominated household. The overall population\ndemonstrated 95.7 % a relatively high literacy rate, with 26 persons have\nprimary education, 89 have secondary pass and 20 persons have\ngraduation or above qualification and 1 person have a technical level\neducation. All children (ages 6-14) were reported to be enrolled in school,\nindicating good access to basic education. However, opportunities for\nhigher education are limited locally, requiring migration to the mainland,\nparticularly to Kerala. The total population affected by the proposed\nproject is 140 individuals, comprising 28 children below 18 years of age, 88 adults\nbetween 18 and 55 years, and 24 elderly persons above 55 years. Out of the\ntotal, 98 individuals are reported to be married.\n\nLivelihoods, Occupation and Income Sources:\n\nThe affected households in the proposed land acquisition area maintain a\nmixed livelihood pattern, combining agriculture, coconut farming, and\nservice-based employment. Among the adult population above 18 years,\nthe primary occupations include 40 homemakers, 31 self-employed\nindividuals, 17 government employees, 16 unemployed persons, 6 retired\nemployees, 1 retired driver, and only 1 coconut farmer. Out of the six\nlandowning families, three fall under the Below Poverty Line (BPL) category,\nindicating economic vulnerability. While some households possess small\nparcels of alternative agricultural land, these are insufficient to ensure full\nlivelihood continuity. Income information was largely undisclosed; only one\nhousehold reported a monthly income of ₹10,000, which is modest and\nunstable. Overall, the economic base of the affected households is fragile,\ncombining low-return land-based activities with limited and uncertain\nservice employment opportunities.\n\nBasic amenities are present, including pucca houses with toilet facilities,\ncooking fuel through LPG and/or firewood, and access to drinking water\nfrom either private wells or desalination plant supply. This semi-subsistence\nlifestyle reflects a low-income and insecure rural household economy,\ncombining traditional land-based practices with limited formal\nemployment opportunities, making these households more vulnerable to\nlivelihood disruption due to land acquisition.\n\nPoverty, Vulnerability, and Access to Welfare Schemes:\n\nAmong the six affected landowning families, three fall under the Below\nPoverty Line (BPL) category, highlighting a significant degree of vulnerability\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD. Page 14\n\n**Page 17**\n\nSocial Impact Assessment\n\nwithin the group. While food security is generally maintained and no\nhousehold reported skipping meals, some families rely heavily on subsidized\nfood grains and government welfare provisions such as the Public\nDistribution System (PDS), Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS),\nand the Mid-Day Meal Scheme. The presence of BPL households indicates\nthat a portion of the affected families face greater economic insecurity,\nwith concerns regarding employment opportunities and the stability of their\nincome sources. These vulnerabilities could be further aggravated by the\nacquisition process, underscoring the need for careful mitigation and\nsupport measures.\n\nAssets, Housing, and Infrastructure Access:\n\nOut of 6 affected land owners, 5 land owners are living in Amini Island and\nonly 1 land owner is living in Kadmat Island but not on the acquired land.\nThey live in pucca and tiled houses, with no displacement required due to\nthe project. Basic amenities such as electricity, primary healthcare (PHC\nand private doctor), and anganwadi services are available and\naccessible. However, the water supply is limited, with piped desalinated\nwater supplied. Households rely on private wells for non-drinking uses.\nSewage infrastructure is inadequate, with soak pits or open drains\ncommonly used. Transport and market access are fair within the island,\nsupported by a pucca road network.\n\nSocial Structure, Community Dynamics, and Aspirations:\n\nThe island follows a patriarchal but socially cohesive system with strong\nkinship ties and high community participation. Religious institutions like\nmosques play a central role in cultural life and decision-making. There is\nminimal crime, and a peaceful atmosphere prevails. Women enjoy a fair\ndegree of mobility and freedom; though economic participation remains\nlimited. The community is aspirational, especially among the youth who\nseek education and skill development for better employment prospects.\nThe local economy's over-reliance on traditional sectors like fishing and\ngovernment service is seen as a constraint, and residents expressed hope\nthat infrastructure improvements will lead to diversified livelihood options.\n\n6. Social Impacts\n\nImpact on Land and Livelihoods:\n\nThe project involves the acquisition of 7000 square meters of private land,\nimpacting 6 land owners in terms of landholding but not resulting in any\nphysical displacement. The land being acquired is not used for residential\nor commercial purposes or as a primary livelihood base, as no major\nagricultural activities or big commercial enterprises. While 54 coconut trees\non these plots contribute marginally to household income, the loss is limited\nand compensable. Moreover, since the affected families do not depend\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD. Page 5\n\n**Page 18**\n\nShifting & Development of Helipad\n\non the land for their primary sustenance, the risk of impoverishment or\ndisruption in livelihood is minimal.\n\nImpact on Infrastructure and Public Utilities:\n\nThere will be no significant adverse impact on existing infrastructure or public\nutilities. The project site has been carefully selected to avoid any disruption\nto essential services such as roads, electricity lines, water supply, drainage, and\ncommunication networks. The area identified for acquisition does not include\nany public infrastructure installations, and all utilities in the vicinity will remain\nfunctional throughout the construction and operational phases. Any minor\nadjustments, if required, will be managed with proper coordination to\nensure uninterrupted access to public services for the local community.\n\nImpact on Vulnerable Groups and Social Equity:\n\nThe shifting of the helipad at Kadmat Island will have negligible impact on\nvulnerable groups, as no households from socially or economically\ndisadvantaged categories are located within the proposed acquisition\narea. There will be no displacement or loss of livelihood for such\ncommunities. Instead, the improved facility will enhance emergency\naccess, disaster response, and essential services for vulnerable sections of\nthe population.\n\nImpact on Cultural and Social Fabric:\n\nThe project for shifting and developing the helipad at Kadmat Island is not\nexpected to adversely affect the island's cultural or social life, as the\nselected site does not encroach upon any place of worship, heritage\nstructure, or community gathering space. Local customs, traditions, and\nsocial activities will continue uninterrupted during and after construction.\nOn the contrary, improved connectivity may strengthen social ties by\nfacilitating easier movement for cultural events, family visits, and\ncommunity interactions.\n\nEnvironmental and Health Considerations in the Social Context:\n\nThe proposed shifting and development of the helipad at Kadmat Island\nwill have minimal adverse environmental impact, as the selected site avoids\necologically sensitive areas such as coral reefs, lagoon waters, and dense\nvegetation. Construction activities will follow environmental safeguards to\ncontrol noise, dust, and waste, thereby preventing health risks to the local\npopulation. In the long term, improved air connectivity will enhance public\nhealth outcomes by enabling faster medical evacuations and timely\ndelivery of healthcare services and supplies.\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD. Page 16\n\n**Page 19**\n\nSocial Impact Assessment\n\n7. Impact on Physical Resources\n\nLand, Soil, and Vegetation:\n\nThe acquisition of 7,000 square metres of land for the helipad will result in\nthe conversion of a portion of sandy coastal soil, which is generally\nunsuitable for conventional agriculture but well-suited for coconut\nplantation. The identified site currently supports about 54 coconut trees,\nwhich represent a valuable livelihood resource for the affected households.\nWhile the soil itself is not highly productive for food crops, the removal of\nthese coconut trees will directly impact an important component of the\nisland's subsistence and cash economy.\n\nWater conditions in the project area are also influenced by its coastal\nlocation. The soil and groundwater at the site are saline due to proximity to\nthe sea, unlike the central inland parts of Kadmat Island where dug wells\nprovide relatively salinity-free freshwater. At present, all households on the\nisland have access to desalinated water supplied once or twice a week,\nwhich supplements limited groundwater resources.\n\nOverall, while the direct impact on soil productivity is minimal, the loss of\ncoconut trees and saline-sensitive land characteristics require attention.\nMitigation measures such as compensatory coconut plantation in\nalternative locations should be considered to balance ecological and\nlivelihood concerns.\n\nImpact on Common Property Resources and Natural Systems:\n\nThe proposed helipad site does not overlap with any common property\nresources such as community wells, grazing land, or public buildings,\nensuring no disruption to shared community assets. Natural systems,\nincluding the island's lagoon ecosystem and marine resources, will remain\nunaffected as the location is away from sensitive coastal and aquatic\nzones. With appropriate construction safeguards, the project will maintain\nthe integrity of local natural systems while enhancing overall connectivity\nfor the community.\n\n8. Impact on Private Assets, Public Services and Utilities\n\nImpact on Private Assets:\n\nThe land identified for the helipad development does not contain any\nresidential structures or significant private commercial assets, thereby\navoiding displacement or major livelihood loss. Only a limited portion of\nprivately-owned open land will be acquired, with due compensation as per\napplicable laws. Consequently, the impact on private assets is minimal and\nwill be addressed through fair and transparent acquisition procedures.\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD. Page 17\n\n**Page 20**\n\nShifting & Development of Helipad\n\nImpact on Public Services and Utilities:\n\nThe project will not require the removal or relocation of existing public\nservices and utilities such as water supply lines, electricity networks, or\ncommunication infrastructure at the proposed site. During construction,\ncare will be taken to ensure uninterrupted access to essential services for\nthe local population. In the long term, the upgraded helipad will enhance\npublic service delivery by improving emergency response, medical\nevacuation, and administrative connectivity.\n\n9. Health Impacts\n\nHealth Impact During Construction Phase:\n\nDuring the construction phase, temporary health impacts may arise from\ndust generation, noise, and movement of construction machinery,\npotentially causing minor discomfort to nearby residents. These effects will\nbe mitigated through measures such as dust suppression, noise control, and\nadherence to safety protocols. With proper implementation of these\nsafeguards, the health risks during construction are expected to be minimal\nand short-term in nature.\n\nHealth Impact Post-Project Implementation:\n\nPost-project implementation, the upgraded helipad will have a positive\nimpact on public health by enabling faster medical evacuations and timely\ntransportation of critical healthcare supplies. Improved connectivity will\nalso facilitate easier access for medical teams and emergency response\nservices to reach the island. Overall, the project is expected to enhance\nhealthcare outcomes and strengthen the community's resilience to\nmedical emergencies.\n\n10. Impact on cultures, social cohesions and gender\n\nImpact on Culture and Social Cohesion:\n\nThe project will not disrupt cultural practices or weaken social cohesion, as\nit does not affect any sites of cultural significance or community gathering\nspaces. Improved connectivity is likely to strengthen community bonds by\nfacilitating participation in cultural events and family interactions.\n\nImpact on Gender Dynamics and Inclusion:\n\nThe improved helipad facility will enhance mobility and safety for women,\nparticularly in accessing healthcare, education, and livelihood\nopportunities. Better connectivity will also promote inclusion by enabling\nequal participation of women and marginalized groups in social,\neconomic, and community activities.\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD. Page 18\n\n**Page 21**\n\nSocial Impact Assessment\n\n11. Mitigation Measures\n\nTo minimise potential negative impacts of the shifting and development of\nthe helipad at Kadmat Island, the project will adopt a range of\nenvironmental, social, and safety measures. Construction activities will be\nplanned to avoid disturbance to ecologically sensitive areas, with dust\nsuppression, noise control, and proper waste disposal practices\nimplemented throughout the works. Loss of 54 coconut trees will be\naddressed through compensatory plantation, and occupational health\nand safety protocols will be strictly followed, including the provision of\nprotective gear, first-aid facilities, and compliance with safety standards.\n\nSocial safeguards will focus on fair and transparent compensation for the\nacquisition of 7,000 square metres of private land in line with the RFCTLARR\nAct, as well as regular communication with the community to address\nconcerns and minimise disruption. Construction schedules will be adjusted\nto limit inconvenience to residents, and care will be taken to safeguard\npublic utilities and maintain emergency access routes at all times.\nCollectively, these measures will ensure that the project is implemented in\na socially responsible, environmentally sustainable, and community-friendly\nmanner.\n\n12. Assessment of Social Costs& Benefits\n\nThe proposed Shifting and Development of Helipad at Kadmat Island\npresents a development initiative with limited social costs and significant,\nlong-term social benefits for the island's population and surrounding\ncommunities.\n\nSocial Cost\n\nThe primary social cost of the shifting and development of the helipad at\nKadmat Island arises from the acquisition of 7,000 square metres of land and\nloss of 54 coconut trees, which involves the loss of a limited portion of\nprivately-owned open land and minor alteration of the existing landscape.\nTemporary inconveniences may occur during the construction phase due\nto noise, dust, and restricted movement in certain areas. While the impact\non vulnerable groups, cultural resources, and livelihoods is minimal, these\ncosts will be addressed through fair compensation, environmental\nsafeguards, and community engagement measures.\n\nSocial Benefit\n\nThe project will deliver significant social benefits by enhancing air\nconnectivity, enabling faster medical evacuations, improving disaster\nresponse capacity, and facilitating the timely delivery of essential services\nand supplies. It will also support the mobility of residents, promote controlled\ntourism, and create opportunities for greater economic participation,\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.

It is valued for its rich marine biodiversity, traditional\nfishing-based economy, cultural heritage, and growing role in eco-\ntourism and community life. Recognising the urgent need to provide\nstudents of the Government Senior Basic School, Kadmat Island, with a\nsafe, dedicated space for physical activity, holistic development, and\ncommunity recreation, supporting education, health, and social well-\nbeing at Kadmat Island.\n\nThis Social Impact Assessment (SIA) Report has been prepared under the\nRight to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,\nRehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (RFCTLARR Act) and\ncorresponding Lakshadweep regulations. The objective of the SIA is to\nassess the likely social impacts arising from the acquisition of 1,570 square\nmeters of land for the construction of the playground of the Government\nSenior Basic School. Identify concerns and expectations of affected\nstakeholders, and propose effective mitigation strategies to ensure\nequitable, inclusive, and sustainable development.\n\nThe report draws upon a comprehensive review of land records,\nstakeholder consultations, field surveys, and institutional inputs from the\nDepartment of Education, and other relevant administrative authorities.\nIt aims to provide actionable recommendations that balance\neducational infrastructure development with the well-being of students\nand others, sensitivity to local environmental conditions, and respect for\nsocio-cultural values. This document lays the groundwork for a child-\nfriendly community initiative that is expected to enhance school\nfacilities, promote physical activity, and support Kadmat's role as an\ninclusive and education-focused island in the Lakshadweep group.\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage li\n\n**Page 4**\n\nPlayground for Government Girls Senior Secondary School\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThe preparation of this Social Impact Assessment (SIA) Report for the\nproposed development of the Kadmat playground for the Government\nSenior Basic School has been made possible through the collective\nefforts, guidance, and cooperation of various institutions, departments,\nand individuals committed to the children's physical development,\neducational infrastructure support and Community recreational value.\n\nWe express our sincere gratitude to the District Administration of\nLakshadweep, Department of Education, Principal of Government\nSenior Basic School, School administration and local community for their\nconsistent support, timely inputs, and access to essential project\ndocumentation and land records. We are especially thankful to the\nRevenue Department and the Office of the Deputy Collector, Kadmat,\nfor facilitating land verification processes, stakeholder interactions, and\nfield visits, which were crucial to the accuracy and completeness of this\nassessment.\n\nOur special thanks to Shri Rajthilak S, IFS, Chairman of the Social Impact\nAssessment & Consent Society (SIA & CS), Lakshadweep Administration,\nand Shri C.N. Abdul Raheem, Office Secretary, SIA & CS, for their\ninvaluable coordination, inputs, and administrative support throughout\nthe preparation of this report.\n\nOur heartfelt thanks go to the residents of Kadmat Island, including the\nProject Affected Families (PAFs), community representatives, and local\ninstitutions like the village panchayat, for their active participation in\nconsultations, honest feedback, and constructive suggestions. Their\ninsights have helped shape a more inclusive and socially sensitive\nframework for project implementation.\n\nWe also acknowledge the contributions of field investigators, social\nworkers, and local coordinators whose dedicated efforts enabled the\nsmooth execution of surveys, documentation, and data verification.\n\nThis report is the outcome of their collective commitment to inclusive\neducational development, community well-being, and the creation of\na safe, accessible, and student-friendly playground for the children of\nKadmat and the broader Lakshadweep islands.\n\nAjay Agrawal\nManaging Director\nAtharva Planning and Research Centre Pvt.Ltd.\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage | ii\n\n**Page 5**\n\nSocial Impact Assessment\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis Social Impact Assessment (SIA) report has been prepared using a\ncombination of secondary information provided by relevant\nGovernment departments and primary data collected through field\nvisits, stakeholder consultations, and interviews with directly affected\nindividuals and households. Every effort has been made to present the\ndata as accurately and objectively as possible. However, it is essential\nto acknowledge that specific details provided by stakeholders were\neither partial, incomplete, or not disclosed during the data collection\nprocess. Additionally, in some instances, access to complete official\nrecords or verification of specific information was limited due to time\nconstraints or unavailability.\n\nIt is important to note that the official documents regarding the land\nproposed for acquisition for the development of the Government Senior\nBasic School Playground at Kadmat are consistent and specify the total\nland area as 1,570 square metres, as outlined in Notification No.\nF.No.34/5/2022-LR/716 dated 26.05.2025. This Social Impact Assessment\nreport is based on verified land records, survey data, and field-level\nsocio-economic information collected during the course of the study. All\nnine respondents agreed to cooperate. Accordingly, the findings and\ninterpretations in this report are based on the most consistent and\nverifiable information available at the time of preparation.\n\nThe SIA team does not assume responsibility for any discrepancies that\nmay arise from future clarifications, revisions, or official corrections. Since\nDPR is not provided by the LPWD and there was no development cost\nmentioned in the provided documents, we have estimated the cost of\nthe proposed Kadmat Playground project for the Government Senior\nBasic School to be approximately ₹18–22 lakhs on the basis of market\nvalue. This includes expenses for site preparation and levelling,\ninstallation of play equipment, construction of boundary fencing,\ndevelopment of basic sports infrastructure, provision of benches and\nshaded resting areas, a drinking water point, drainage facilities, solar-\npowered lighting, and necessary signage. The total also accounts for\ncontingencies and supervision charges to ensure smooth execution of\nthe project in a remote island setting.\n\nThis report is intended solely for Social Impact Assessment purposes as\nper the requirements of The Right to Fair Compensation and\nTransparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act,\n2013, and its Rules, 2014, including subsequent amendments, and should\nbe interpreted in that context.\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT.

Background of the Project and its details\nSocial Impact Assessment\n\nThe Union Territory of Lakshadweep comprises 36 small coral islands in\nthe Arabian Sea with a total land area of just 32.62 sq. km, of which only\n10 islands are inhabited. As per the 2011 Census, the total population is\n64,473. The islands are ecologically sensitive and geographically\nisolated, relying on air and sea connectivity primarily via Cochin. The\nadministration seeks to balance infrastructure development with\necological conservation to enhance residents' quality of life and support\nsustainable tourism across the territory.\n\nKadmat Island, spanning 3.84 sq. km with a population of 7,566 (2011\nCensus), is a key island in Lakshadweep due to its only aerodrome that\nlinks the UT to mainland India-situated at 11.2241° N latitude and\n72.7762°E longitude. Known for its coral-rich lagoons and pristine\nbeaches, Kadmat holds significant ecological and tourism potential.\nHowever, the western side of the island suffers from inadequate\ninfrastructure, limiting access, development opportunities, and disaster\npreparedness. The island is now poised for strategic interventions to\nenhance its connectivity and eco-tourism offerings. However, the school\ncurrently lacks a dedicated and structured outdoor space where\nstudents and others can engage in physical activities, sports, and\nrecreational learning in a safe and organised environment. Recognising\nthis critical need, the Administration has proposed the development of\na playground within the Government Senior Basic School campus at\nKadmat Island to support the physical, mental, and social development\nof children.\n\nThe proposed Government Senior Basic School Playground at Kadmat\nIsland is envisioned as a safe, inclusive, and student-friendly open space\nthat supports physical education, sports, and recreational activities for\nschool children. A total 9 number of households were affected, and the\nproject involves the acquisition of approximately 1,570 square metres of\nland exclusively for the construction of the playground within the\nGovernment Senior Basic School campus. The planned development is\nexpected to include basic sports infrastructure, play equipment, shaded\nseating areas, boundary fencing, and landscaping elements suited to\nthe local environment. Special attention is being given to ensuring\nsafety, accessibility for all children, including girls and those with\ndisabilities and integration with the existing school layout. The design will\nreflect ecological sensitivity by incorporating native vegetation, natural\ndrainage, and open space planning that enhances the learning\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 1\n\n**Page 14**\n\nPlayground for Government Girls Senior Secondary School\n\nenvironment while maintaining the cultural and environmental context\nof Kadmat Island.\n\nCommunity consultations conducted as part of the Social Impact\nAssessment (SIA) process reflected broad support among residents and\nschool stakeholders for the proposed playground project, particularly for\nits role in enhancing the physical development, well-being, and\nrecreational opportunities of school children. Participants emphasised\nthe importance of maintaining the ecological balance of the school\nsurroundings and ensuring that the playground integrates safely with\nexisting infrastructure without disrupting daily academic activities. These\ninsights have informed the recommendations of the SIA, which stress the\nimportance of limited and well-defined land acquisition, timely and\ntransparent compensation for affected landowners, and the adoption\nof child-safe, inclusive design principles. If implemented with community\ninvolvement and environmental care, the Government Senior Basic\nSchool Playground at Kadmat has the potential to serve as a replicable\nmodel for school-based open space development in small island\ncontexts.\n\n2. Public Purpose\n\nThe proposed development of the playground at Government Senior\nBasic School, Kadmat, serves a vital public purpose by addressing the\nlong-standing need for a safe, structured, and inclusive outdoor space\nto support the physical, emotional, and social development of school\nchildren. At present, the school lacks a designated playground area,\nlimiting opportunities for sports, recreational learning, and physical\neducation-an essential component of holistic child development\nunder the national education framework.\n\nThe Government Senior Basic School Playground project seeks to bridge\nthis critical gap by developing a student-friendly, ecologically sensitive,\nand well-demarcated play space within the school premises. The\nproposed site spans approximately 1,570 square metres, identified as the\nminimum required area to accommodate core playground elements\nsuch as open play fields, basic sports infrastructure, shaded seating, and\nsafety features. The land proposed for acquisition comprises specific\nprivate land parcels adjoining the school, carefully chosen to ensure\nminimum disruption to surrounding uses and maximum benefit to the\nstudent population.\n\nThis initiative is expected to yield long-term public benefits by enhancing\nthe educational environment, encouraging physical well-being,\nsupporting co-curricular learning, and creating a community-friendly\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 2\n\n**Page 15**\n\nSocial Impact Assessment\n\nasset. It aligns with broader goals of inclusive education, child safety,\nand local infrastructure development, while remaining sensitive to the\nisland's cultural and environmental context.\n\n3. Location\n\nThe proposed site for the Government Senior Basic School Playground is\nlocated adjacent to the premises of the Government Senior Basic School\nin Kadmat Island, at approximate geographic coordinates 11.2241° N\nlatitude and 72.7762° E longitude. The total area designated for the\nproject is 1,570 square metres, consisting of selected privately owned\nland parcels identified for acquisition to build the school's outdoor\nspace. The site has been carefully chosen to ensure safe and direct\naccess for students and other people, seamless integration with the\nexisting school infrastructure, and minimal environmental disturbance. Its\nproximity to the main road and residential clusters also enables\noccasional community use while maintaining the primary function of\nserving the educational and physical development needs of children\nenrolled at Government Senior Basic School.\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT.

Shifting the project to another location\nwould have required substantial land acquisition involving inhabited\nareas, which could lead to legal complications, resistance from\nresidents, and potential delays. In contrast, the selected site requires\nminimal land acquisition, avoids any resettlement, and directly\ncomplements the existing school infrastructure.\n\nGiven these factors, and to ensure minimal disruption while maximising\nfunctional integration with the Government Senior Basic School,\nexploring alternative sites was not considered appropriate for this\nproject.\n\n5. Socio-economic condition of affected families\n\nDemographic and Educational Profile:\n\nThe affected families belong entirely to the Scheduled Tribe (ST)\ncategory and follow Islam as their religion. A total of 9 families,\ncomprising 128 individuals, have cooperated with the survey as part of\nthis Social Impact Assessment. Of these, 65 are males, 63 are females,\nindicating a relatively imbalanced gender distribution across\nhouseholds, which may also be due to some families not cooperating.\n\nAmong the nine affected families identified for the proposed\ndevelopment of the Kadmat playground for the Government Senior\nBasic School, a total of 50 adult male members (aged 18 years and\nabove) were recorded. Of these, 12 had completed primary education\n(up to Class V), 26 had attained secondary-level education (up to Class\nX), 33 held graduate-level or higher academic qualifications, and 2\npossessed technical degrees.\n\nAmong the nine affected families identified for the proposed Kadmat\nplayground for the Government Senior Basic School, a total of 48 adult\nfemale members (aged 18 years and above) were recorded. Of these,\n16 individuals had attained education up to the primary school level\n(Class V), while 26 individuals had studied up to the secondary\neducation level (Class X). Additionally, 12 adult females held\nqualifications at the graduate level or above.\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 5\n\n**Page 18**\n\nPlayground for Government Girls Senior Secondary School\n\nLivelihoods, Occupation and Income Sources:\n\nIn Kadmat, among 63 women, the major groups are 24 homemakers, 17\nunemployed, 14 students, with only 1 in government service, 2 self-\nemployed, 2 elderly, and 3 not specified, while among 65 men, key\noccupations include 15 self-employed, 15 students, 9 unemployed, 8\ncoconut farmers, 8 government employees, 6 retired employees, 2\ncontract employees, and 2 not specified, showing that the island's\neconomy relies mainly on household work, education-linked\ndependence, agriculture (coconut farming), self-employment, and\nlimited government or contractual jobs.\n\nPoverty, Vulnerability, and Access to Welfare Schemes:\n\nAll the affected families fall under the Above Poverty Line (APL)\ncategory. The surveyed population demonstrates a mix of traditional\nand modern livelihood activities, including coconut harvesting, self-\nemployment, and government employment. In Kadmat, poverty and\nvulnerability are evident as 17 women and nine men are unemployed,\n24 women are homemakers, and most income comes from small-scale\nactivities like eight male coconut farmers, 15 self-employed men and\ntwo women, making many households reliant on welfare schemes such\nas PDS, pensions, and scholarships to sustain their livelihoods.\n\nAssets, Housing, and Infrastructure Access:\n\nThe acquisition land for the proposed playground in Kadmat contains\nno residential households or housing structures. Still, it has coconut trees\nas the only productive assets. In contrast, the wider community has\naccess to basic infrastructure such as electricity, PDS, schools, and\nhealth facilities, though water supply and external connectivity remain\nlimited.\n\nSocial Structure, Community Dynamics, and Aspirations:\n\nThe community in Kadmat is characterised by a close-knit social\nstructure rooted in kinship and shared livelihoods such as coconut\nfarming and fishing, where collective decision-making and Gram Sabha\nparticipation are strong, and aspirations are centred on better\neducational opportunities, recreational spaces like the proposed\nplayground, improved livelihood options, and enhanced connectivity\nwith the mainland.\n\n6. Social Impacts\n\nImpact on Land and Livelihoods:\n\nThe proposed acquisition of 1,570 sq.m of land for the development of a\nplayground at the Government Senior Basic School, Kadmat will not\nlead to physical displacement of households, as there are no residential\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 6\n\n**Page 19**\n\nSocial Impact Assessment\n\nstructures or dwellings on the identified land. However, the land contains\na number of coconut trees, which represent a valuable productive asset\nfor local livelihoods. The loss of these trees may have a minor economic\nimpact on the landholders, as coconut cultivation is an important\nsupplementary income source in Kadmat Island. At the same time, the\nproject is expected to generate long-term positive livelihood impacts by\nimproving the school environment, promoting physical education, and\nfostering opportunities for local youth to engage in sports and\nextracurricular activities. This may contribute indirectly to skill\ndevelopment, social cohesion, and health benefits, which are important\nfor the island's socio-economic development. With appropriate\ncompensation for the lost coconut trees, the adverse impact on\nlivelihoods can be mitigated, ensuring a fair balance between\ncommunity needs and development goals.\n\nImpact on Infrastructure and Public Utilities:\n\nThe acquisition of 1,570 sq.m of land for the proposed playground at the\nGovernment Senior Basic School, Kadmat will have no adverse impact\non existing public infrastructure or utilities, as the identified land does not\ncontain any residential structures, public buildings, water pipelines,\npower lines, or road networks. The project will therefore not disrupt\nelectricity, water supply, sanitation, or transport services available to the\ncommunity. On the contrary, the construction of the playground will\nserve as an enhancement of educational and recreational\ninfrastructure, providing a dedicated and safe space for students to\nengage in physical activities, sports, and outdoor learning. This will\nstrengthen the school's facilities, contribute to student well-being, and\ncreate a common space that may also benefit the broader community\nduring non-school hours. Thus, while the project has minimal negative\nimplications, it brings tangible positive impacts by improving the quality\nof public educational infrastructure on the island.\n\nImpact on Vulnerable Groups and Social Equity\n\nThe project has no direct displacement or housing loss, which minimises\nadverse impacts on vulnerable groups; however, specific community\nsegments such as women (63 surveyed), unemployed youth (26 total),\nhomemakers (24), and the elderly (8, including retired and old-age\ndependents) represent socially and economically vulnerable\ncategories. For these groups, dependence on limited income sources\nlike coconut farming, self-employment, and government welfare\nschemes makes them more sensitive to any loss of assets such as\ncoconut trees. At the same time, the playground project is expected to\npromote social equity by creating a shared recreational space\naccessible to all students, including girls and children from\ndisadvantaged households, thereby fostering inclusiveness and social\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 17\n\n**Page 20**\n\nPlayground for Government Girls Senior Secondary School\n\ncohesion. In the long term, the project may reduce inequities by\nencouraging youth engagement, health improvement, and equal\nparticipation in sports and education, ensuring that vulnerable groups\nare not excluded from development benefits.\n\nImpact on Cultural and Social Fabric:\n\nThe acquisition of land for the proposed playground in Kadmat does not\ninvolve the removal of any cultural, religious, or heritage structures and,\ntherefore, will not directly disrupt traditional practices or community\ninstitutions. Instead, the project is anticipated to have a positive\ninfluence on the island's social fabric, as it will provide a common space\nfor children and youth to participate in sports, games, and outdoor\nactivities, thereby strengthening bonds of friendship, teamwork, and\ncollective identity. By offering an inclusive recreational facility, the\nplayground will promote greater gender participation in physical\nactivities, encourage inter-house competitions, and serve as a venue for\ncultural and social events linked to the school community. In the long\nterm, this development is expected to reinforce community pride, social\ncohesion, and cultural continuity, while aligning with the aspirations of\nfamilies who seek better educational and holistic development\nopportunities for their children.\n\nEnvironmental and Health Considerations in the Social Context:\n\nThe proposed playground project in Kadmat will have minimal\nenvironmental risks, as the acquisition area does not include residential\nsettlements, water bodies, or sensitive ecosystems beyond the presence\nof coconut trees. The removal of these trees represents a minor\necological loss, but it can be mitigated through compensatory\nplantation measures within the island, ensuring that the overall green\ncover is maintained. From a health perspective, the playground is\nexpected to deliver significant positive social outcomes by providing\nstudents with a safe and dedicated space for physical exercise, which\ncontributes to the prevention of lifestyle-related health issues and\nsupports mental well-being. Additionally, by encouraging outdoor\nactivities, the project will reduce children's reliance on limited indoor or\nunsafe play areas, thereby lowering risks of accidents and promoting\nhealthier growth. In the broader social context, the playground may also\nserve as a community space that fosters collective well-being, stress\nreduction, and social interaction, linking environmental stewardship with\nimproved public health outcomes.\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 18\n\n**Page 21**\n\nSocial Impact Assessment\n\n7. Impact on Physical Resources\n\nLand, Soil, and Vegetation:\n\nThe acquisition of 1,570 sq.m of land for the playground will lead to a\nchange in land use from coconut cultivation to institutional recreational\nuse. Since no households or built-up structures are present, the physical\nimpact is limited to the removal of coconut trees, which currently serve\nas productive vegetation and contribute to both livelihoods and the\nisland's green cover. The soil in the acquired area is sandy and typical\nof coastal ecosystems; its conversion for playground development will\ninvolve levelling and compaction, which may reduce the natural soil\nproductivity but will not significantly affect the broader island\necosystem. Vegetation loss is restricted to the coconut trees located\nwithin the acquisition boundary, and no other ecologically sensitive\nspecies or habitats are directly impacted. With appropriate mitigation,\nsuch as compensatory planting of coconut or shade-giving trees in\nnearby areas and sustainable land preparation practices, the negative\nenvironmental impacts on land, soil, and vegetation can be minimised\nwhile ensuring the creation of a safe and functional play space.\n\n7.2 Impact on Common Property Resources and Natural Systems:\n\nThe acquisition of 1,570 sq.m of land for the playground does not involve\nthe diversion of any common property resources such as community\nwells, grazing areas, burial grounds, religious structures, or public\npathways, ensuring that the project does not disrupt traditional\ncommunity assets or access rights. The primary natural resources\naffected are the coconut trees within the acquisition area, which serve\nas both livelihood assets and part of the island's vegetation cover.\n\n8. Impact on Private Assets, Public Services and Utilities\n\nImpact on Private Assets:\n\nThe proposed acquisition of 1,570 sq.m of land for the Kadmat school\nplayground will not affect any residential houses or privately built\nstructures, as no households exist within the project boundary. The only\nprivate assets impacted are the coconut trees standing on the identified\nland, which form part of the productive assets of the landowners. These\ntrees contribute to household income, food security, and traditional uses\nsuch as oil and co"

Background of the Project and its details\nSocial Impact Assessment\n\nThe Union Territory of Lakshadweep comprises 36 small coral islands in the\nArabian Sea, with a total land area of just 32.62 square kilometres, of which\nonly 10 islands are inhabited. As per the 2011 Census, the total population\nis 64,473. The islands are ecologically sensitive and geographically isolated,\nrelying on air and sea connectivity primarily via Cochin. The administration\naims to strike a balance between infrastructure development and\necological conservation, thereby enhancing residents' quality of life and\npromoting sustainable tourism throughout the territory.\n\nAgatti Island, covering an area of 3.22 square kilometres and home to a\npopulation of 7,566 (Census 2011), is a strategically important island within\nthe Union Territory of Lakshadweep. Positioned at 10°51′ North latitude and\n72°11' East longitude, it is located approximately 459 kilometres west of\nKochi. Agatti serves as the primary gateway to the Lakshadweep\narchipelago, housing the territory's only aerodrome that connects the\nislands to mainland India. Renowned for its vibrant coral lagoons and\nunspoiled beaches, the island possesses immense ecological and tourism\nvalue. Despite its significance, the western side of Agatti remains\nunderdeveloped, with limited infrastructure that hampers accessibility,\nsustainable development, and disaster resilience. The island is now the\nfocus of strategic interventions aimed at strengthening connectivity and\npromoting eco-tourism in a planned and sustainable manner.\n\nThe proposed expansion of the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital\n(RGSH) at Agatti Island is a vital public health initiative designed to upgrade\nand modernise medical infrastructure in the Lakshadweep Islands. The\nexisting 30-bedded facility is insufficient to meet the rising healthcare needs\nof both the local population and patients from other islands who are\nfrequently brought in through medical evacuations. The existing hospital will\nbe demolished, and a new 50-bed super-speciality hospital will be\nconstructed at the same place after acquiring the adjacent land. The\nproject involves the acquisition of 3,458 square meters of private land and\n1,940 square meters of accreted government land, as well as community-\nused spaces such as areas with coconut trees and a fenced fish-processing\nzone. Centrally located within the island, the expansion site ensures\nimproved accessibility and will include additional beds, private wards,\ndiagnostic and emergency services, thereby strengthening the overall\nhealth ecosystem and emergency preparedness of the region.\n\nThe Social Impact Assessment (SIA) confirms that while the project is widely\nrecognised as essential for public welfare, community consultations\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 1\n\nExpansion Of RGSH\nemphasised the importance of minimising disruption to common use areas\nand ensuring cultural and ecological sensitivity. To mitigate any potential\nconcerns, the SIA recommends limiting the land acquisition to the minimum\nrequired area, ensuring fair and timely compensation, and implementing\ninclusive employment and skill-building programs for local youth and\nwomen. The project is expected to deliver long-term benefits in terms of\nhealth access, economic opportunity, and resilience, positioning Agatti\nIsland as a key node for health and development within the Lakshadweep\narchipelago.\n\n2. Public Purpose\nThe proposed expansion of the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital\n(RGSH) at Agatti Island serves an essential public purpose by addressing the\ncritical need for advanced healthcare infrastructure in the Union Territory of\nLakshadweep. The current 30-bedded hospital is insufficient to meet the\ngrowing healthcare demands of both Agatti's residents and patients\nreferred from other islands. With the island serving as the primary medical\nevacuation point and a key tourist hub, the expansion will significantly\nenhance access to timely and high-quality healthcare. To fulfil this\nobjective without causing undue disruption, the project proposes the\nacquisition of only 3,458 square meters of land, carefully identified as the\nbare minimum required for expanding hospital services, including beds,\ndiagnostics, emergency care, and private wards. This ensures that the\nproject delivers public health benefits while maintaining sensitivity to land\nuse, community space, and cultural settings.\n\n3. Location\nThe proposed site for the project is located near the western coastline of\nAgatti Island, at geographic coordinates 10.8657195°N and 72.1937440°E. It\nspans a total area of 10,487.31 square metres, comprising 1,940 square\nmetres of accreted land, 3,458 square metres of private land identified for\nacquisition, and the remaining portion consisting of existing government\nland.\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT.

Agatti Island, the only island with an operational airport and a principal entry point to the archipelago, holds strategic significance as a growing centre for tourism, administration, and public engagement. Recognising the opportunity to enhance both the liveability and vibrancy of Agatti, the Administration of Lakshadweep has proposed the development of a playground at Agatti Government Senior Basic School for improvement of children's physical development, educational infrastructure support and Community recreational value.\n\nThis Social Impact Assessment (SIA) Report has been prepared in accordance with the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (RFCTLARR Act) and the relevant Lakshadweep regulations. The report evaluates the potential social implications of acquiring 1507 square metres of land which includes 28 private holdings for the development of the playground at Government Senior Basic School. It identifies the concerns of the affected families, assesses the socio-economic in context of the school and surrounding community, and suggests mitigation strategies to ensure that the development of the playground is inclusive, equitable, and supportive of children's well-being and community needs.\n\nThe report draws upon a comprehensive review of land records, stakeholder consultations, field surveys, and institutional inputs from the, Department of Education, and other relevant administrative authorities. It aims to provide actionable recommendations that balance educational infrastructure development with the well-being of students and others, sensitivity to local environmental conditions, and respect for socio-cultural values. This document lays the groundwork for a child-friendly community initiative that is expected to enhance school facilities, promote physical activity, and support Agatti's role as an inclusive and education-focused island in the Lakshadweep group.\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage li\n\n**Page 4**\n\nSocial Impact Assessment\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nThe preparation of this Social Impact Assessment (SIA) Report for the proposed development of the Agatti playground for Government Senior Basic School has been made possible through the collective efforts, guidance, and cooperation of various institutions, departments, and individuals committed to the children's physical development, educational infrastructure support and Community recreational value.\n\nWe express our sincere gratitude to the District Administration of Lakshadweep, Department of Education, Principal of Government Senior Basic School, School administration and local community for their consistent support, timely inputs, and access to essential project documentation and land records. We are especially thankful to the Revenue Department and the Office of the Deputy Collector, Agatti, for facilitating land verification processes, stakeholder interactions, and field visits, which were crucial to the accuracy and completeness of this assessment.\n\nOur special thanks to Shri Rajthilak S, IFS, Chairman of the Social Impact Assessment & Consent Society (SIA & CS), Lakshadweep Administration, and Shri C.N. Abdul Raheem, Office Secretary, SIA & CS, for their invaluable coordination, inputs, and administrative support throughout the preparation of this report.\n\nWe are deeply grateful to the residents of Agatti Island, including Project-Affected Families (PAFs), community members, and local institutions such as the Village Dweep Panchayat, for their active participation in public consultations, transparent feedback, and constructive suggestions. Their insights have been vital in shaping a development approach that respects local needs, traditions, and aspirations.\n\nWe also acknowledge the contributions of field investigators, social workers, and local coordinators whose dedicated efforts enabled smooth execution of surveys, documentation, and data verification.\n\nThis report is the outcome of their collective commitment to inclusive educational development, community well-being, and the creation of a safe, accessible, and student-friendly playground for the children of Agatti and the broader Lakshadweep islands.\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage | ii\n\n**Page 5**\n\nConstruction Of Playground\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThis Social Impact Assessment (SIA) report has been prepared using a combination of secondary information provided by relevant Government departments and primary data collected through field visits, stakeholder consultations, and interviews with directly affected individuals and households. Every effort has been made to present the data as accurately and objectively as possible. However, it is important to acknowledge that certain details provided by stakeholders were either partial, incomplete, or not disclosed during the data collection process. Additionally, in some instances, access to complete official records or verification of specific information was limited due to time constraints or non-availability.\n\nIt is important to note that the official documents regarding the land proposed for acquisition for the development of the Government Senior Basic School Playground at Agatti are consistent and clearly specify the total land area as 1,507 square metres, as outlined in Notification No. F.No.34/95/2022-LR/720 dated 26.05.2025. This Social Impact Assessment report is based on verified land records, survey data, and field-level socio-economic information collected during the course of the study. From the 30 respondents only 10 respondents agreed to co-operate and 1 was out of station rest 19 respondents didn't co-operate. Accordingly, the findings and interpretations in this report are based on the most consistent and verifiable information available at the time of preparation.\n\nThe SIA team does not assume responsibility for any discrepancies that may arise from future clarifications, revisions, or official corrections. Since, DPR is not provided by the LPWD and there was no development cost mentioned in the provided documents, we have estimated cost of the proposed Agatti Playground project for Government Senior Basic School is approximately ₹18–22 lakhs on the basis of market value. This includes expenses for site preparation and levelling, installation of play equipment, construction of boundary fencing, development of basic sports infrastructure, provision of benches and shaded resting areas, a drinking water point, drainage facilities, solar-powered lighting, and necessary signage. The total also accounts for contingencies and supervision charges to ensure smooth execution of the project in a remote island setting.\n\nThis report is intended solely for Social Impact Assessment purposes as per the requirements of The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, and its Rules, 2014, including subsequent amendments, and should be interpreted in that context.\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT.

Background of the Project and its details\n\nThe Union Territory of Lakshadweep comprises 36 small coral islands in the Arabian Sea, with a total land area of just 32.62 square kilometres, of which only 10 islands are inhabited. As per the 2011 Census, the total population is 64,473. The islands are ecologically fragile and geographically isolated, depending heavily on air and sea connectivity via Kochi for most economic, medical, and logistical functions. The Administration of Lakshadweep has been actively working towards balancing infrastructure development with ecological conservation aiming to improve the quality of life for its residents while promoting sustainable, culturally grounded tourism across the territory.\n\nAgatti Island, with a geographical area of 3.22 square kilometres and a population of 7,566 (Census 2011), is one of the most strategically significant islands in the archipelago. Situated at 10°51′ North latitude and 72°11' East longitude, and located approximately 459 kilometres west of Kochi, Agatti serves as the primary gateway to Lakshadweep, being home to the territory's only operational airport. Its picturesque white sand beaches, vibrant coral ecosystems, and lagoon-rich geography give it immense ecological and tourism potential. However, the school currently lacks a dedicated and structured outdoor space where students and also others can engage in physical activities, sports, and recreational learning in a safe and organised environment. Recognising this critical need, the Administration has proposed the development of a playground within the Government Senior Basic School campus at Agatti Island to support the physical, mental, and social development of children.\n\nThe proposed Government Senior Basic School Playground at Agatti Island is envisioned as a safe, inclusive, and Student-friendly open space that supports physical education, sports, and recreational activities for school children. Total 30 number of households were affected and the project involves the acquisition of approximately 1,507 square metres of land exclusively for the construction of the playground within the Government Senior Basic School campus. The planned development is expected to include basic sports infrastructure, play equipment, shaded seating areas, boundary fencing, and landscaping elements suited to the local environment. Special attention is being given to ensuring safety, accessibility for all children including girls and those with disabilities and integration with the existing school layout. The design will reflect ecological sensitivity by incorporating native vegetation, natural drainage, and open space planning that enhances the learning\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 1\n\n**Page 16**\n\nSocial Impact Assessment\n\nenvironment while maintaining the cultural and environmental context of Agatti Island.\n\nCommunity consultations conducted as part of the Social Impact Assessment (SIA) process reflected broad support among local residents and school stakeholders for the proposed playground project, particularly for its role in enhancing the physical development, well-being, and recreational opportunities of school children. Participants emphasized the importance of maintaining the ecological balance of the school surroundings and ensuring that the playground integrates safely with existing infrastructure without disrupting daily academic activities. These insights have informed the recommendations of the SIA, which stress the importance of limited and well-defined land acquisition, timely and transparent compensation for affected landowners, and the adoption of child-safe, inclusive design principles. If implemented with community involvement and environmental care, the Government Senior Basic School Playground at Agatti has the potential to serve as a replicable model for school-based open space development in small island contexts.\n\n2. Public Purpose\n\nThe proposed development of the playground at Government Senior Basic School, Agatti, serves a vital public purpose by addressing the long-standing need for a safe, structured, and inclusive outdoor space to support the physical, emotional, and social development of school children. At present, the school lacks a designated playground area, limiting opportunities for sports, recreational learning, and physical education-an essential component of holistic child development under the national education framework.\n\nThe Government Senior Basic School Playground project seeks to bridge this critical gap by developing a student-friendly, ecologically sensitive, and well-demarcated play space within the school premises. The proposed site spans approximately 1,507 square metres, identified as the minimum required area to accommodate core playground elements such as open play fields, basic sports infrastructure, shaded seating, and safety features. The land proposed for acquisition comprises specific private land parcels adjoining the school, carefully chosen to ensure minimum disruption to surrounding uses and maximum benefit to the student population.\n\nThis initiative is expected to yield long-term public benefits by enhancing the educational environment, encouraging physical well-being, supporting co-curricular learning, and creating a community-friendly\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 2\n\n**Page 17**\n\nConstruction Of Playground\n\nasset. It aligns with broader goals of inclusive education, child safety, and local infrastructure development, while remaining sensitive to the island's cultural and environmental context.\n\n3. Location\n\nThe proposed site for the Government Senior Basic School Playground is located adjacent to the premises of the Government Senior Basic School in Agatti Island, at approximate geographic coordinates 10.8635528° N and 72.197475°E. The total area designated for the project is 1,507 square metres, consisting of selected privately owned land parcels identified for acquisition to build the school's outdoor space. The site has been carefully chosen to ensure safe and direct access for students and other people, seamless integration with the existing school infrastructure, and minimal environmental disturbance. Its proximity to the main road and residential clusters also enables occasional community use while maintaining the primary function of serving the educational and physical development needs of children enrolled at Government Senior Basic School.\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT.

Alternative sites considered\n\nThe proposed site for the Government Senior Basic School Playground lies adjacent to the existing Government Senior Basic School campus in Agatti Island, which serves as one of the primary educational institutions on the island. This particular site was identified for development because it is free from existing built structures and does not involve the displacement or rehabilitation of any families, unlike nearby areas\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 4\n\n**Page 19**\n\nConstruction Of Playground\n\ncloser to the school where residential construction exists. The project is designed to utilise this vacant land to enhance the physical learning environment of students and other people through a safe, accessible, and dedicated open space for recreation and sports.\n\nConsidering an alternative site for the playground was found to be neither viable nor practical. Shifting the project to another location would have required substantial land acquisition involving inhabited areas, which could lead to legal complications, resistance from local residents, and potential delays. In contrast, the selected site requires minimal land acquisition, avoids any resettlement, and directly complements the existing school infrastructure.\n\nGiven these factors, and to ensure minimal disruption while maximising functional integration with Government Senior Basic School, exploring alternative sites was not considered appropriate for this project.\n\n5. Socio-economic condition of affected families\n\nDemographic and Educational Profile:\nThe affected families belong entirely to the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category and follow Islam as their religion. A total of 30 families, comprising 88 individuals, among which 10 families co-operated, 1 was out of station and 19 families didn't co-operate so 68 individuals were surveyed as part of this Social Impact Assessment. Of these, 31 are males, 37 are females, indicating a relatively imbalanced gender distribution across households and also may be due to some families didn't co-operated.\n\nThe surveyed population consists of 68 individuals across all affected households. Among them, 7 are children below the age of 18 who have completed primary education, 43 individuals with secondary education, 12 graduates, 3 individuals holding technical qualifications and 1 person didn't answer.\n\nThe surveyed population comprises a total of 68 individuals across all affected households. In terms of age distribution, there are 7 children below the age of 18, 49 adults between 18 and 55 years, and 12 elderly individuals above the age of 55. Out of 68 individuals 49 are married and 9 are unmarried and 10 are below 18.\n\nLivelihoods, Occupation and Income Sources:\nThe affected households exhibit a diverse livelihood pattern, encompassing both formal and informal sectors. A total of 10 individuals are students, and 1 is a teacher, indicating active engagement in the education sector. Other occupations include 3 individuals involved in\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 5\n\n**Page 20**\n\nSocial Impact Assessment\n\ntourism operations, 3 in coconut harvesting, and 2 each are seaman and fisherman, reflecting the community's traditional livelihood ties. Additionally, 4 are labour 1 individual each is employed as a ground staff at the airport, airport staff, Anganwadi helper, barber, shopkeeper, and self-employed worker.\n\nAmong the population, 23 individuals are employed as shown above while 15 females are homemakers, and 20 are currently unemployed, highlighting the dependence on a single earning member within many families. Overall, the occupational profile suggests a blend of service- related jobs, traditional livelihoods, and informal labour, with a significant segment engaged in domestic responsibilities or lacking employment.\n\nNone of the families fall below the poverty line (BPL), and the majority of households demonstrate access to basic infrastructure and amenities, such as pucca housing, in-house toilet facilities, and regular sources of drinking water either from private wells or the local desalination plant. Cooking fuel is primarily sourced from LPG cylinders, with some reliance on firewood.\n\nOverall, this livelihood composition reflects a semi-subsistence, low- income rural economy that is gradually integrating formal employment and service-based occupations, while maintaining its traditional roots.\n\nPoverty, Vulnerability, and Access to Welfare Schemes:\nAll the affected families fall under the Above Poverty Line (APL) category. The surveyed population demonstrates a mix of traditional and modern livelihood activities, including fishing, coconut harvesting, and tourism-related services, as well as Government employment and self-employment. While the overall economic profile suggests low to moderate income levels, no household reported any form of food insecurity or meal deprivation. Overall, while economic vulnerabilities persist due to limited employment opportunities, the presence of stable food access, Government welfare linkages, and diversified income sources ensures that the households maintain a level of economic stability. No family was found to be under distress owing to poverty- induced hardship.\n\nAssets, Housing, and Infrastructure Access:\nAll affected households reside in pucca or semi-pucca houses with no requirement for relocation due to the project. Basic amenities are available, including electricity, LPG connections, and access to drinking water through either piped desalinated supply or private wells. Sanitation facilities primarily consist of soak pits or septic tanks, with open drains present in some households. Access to healthcare is available through nearby Primary Health Centre (PHC) and Anganwadi services,\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 16\n\n**Page 21**\n\nConstruction Of Playground\n\nwhile road connectivity to the area is adequate via pucca roads, ensuring fair access to transport and local markets.\n\nSocial Structure, Community Dynamics, and Aspirations:\nThe affected community exhibits a socially cohesive structure with strong kinship bonds and widespread community participation. All families follow Islam, and religious institutions like mosques play a central role in the social and cultural life of the island. The atmosphere is peaceful, and there are no reported conflicts or crime-related concerns. While economic activities are traditionally male-dominated, women actively contribute as homemakers, and some serve in support roles such as Anganwadi helpers. Aspirations among the younger population are evident, with 10 students recorded and 60 individuals having at least primary to graduate-level education, indicating a focus on education. Despite a reliance on informal livelihoods such as fishing, coconut harvesting, and tourism, there is a visible aspiration for stability through service-sector jobs and formal employment, reflecting a gradual shift in occupational ambitions among the residents.\n\n6. Social Impacts\n\nImpact on Land and Livelihoods:\nThe project involves the acquisition of 1507 square meters of private land, impacting 30 families in terms of land ownership but not resulting in any physical displacement. The land being acquired is used as a school's playground and not used for residential purposes or as a primary livelihood base, as no agricultural activities or large commercial enterprises, exist on the proposed plots. While 41 coconut trees, 42 coconut trees non fruited, 2 Bread Fruit tree, 2 Thespesia tree on some plots contribute marginally to household income, the loss is limited and compensable. Moreover, since the affected families do not depend on the land for their primary sustenance, the risk of impoverishment or disruption in livelihood is minimal.\n\nImpact on Infrastructure and Public Utilities:\nThe project for the proposed Government Senior Basic School Playground at Agatti does not involve the removal or disturbance of any critical public infrastructure or utility services. The land identified for acquisition consists of private holdings not presently occupied by Government structures, utility lines, or civic facilities. Field survey data confirms that electricity, drinking water (including desalinated piped supply and private wells), sanitation (through soak pits), and road connectivity are already accessible to the affected families and will remain undisturbed. No telecom towers, drainage systems, or public distribution nodes are situated on the proposed site. Therefore, the\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 17\n\n**Page 22**\n\nSocial Impact Assessment\n\nproject is not expected to cause disruption to any public utilities or infrastructure. On the contrary, the development of the playground is expected to enhance community amenities by improving public recreational facilities within the island.\n\nImpact on Vulnerable Groups and Social Equity\nThe project does not involve the displacement of any families nor adversely affect vulnerable groups such as women-headed households, persons with disabilities, or elderly-only households. All 10 affected families belong to the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category and follow Islam. Data from the household survey confirms that none of the families fall under the Below Poverty Line (BPL) category, and there is no recorded landlessness or homelessness. While a few individuals are part of the affected households, they reside within family systems that provide adequate support, ensuring social protection. The project site comprises private plots with limited livelihood dependency and does not encroach upon common property resources or public infrastructure used by marginalised groups. Furthermore, the proposed development of a playground is expected to enhance the social integration and well- being of the students and other people.\n\nImpact on Cultural and Social Fabric:\nThe proposed development of the Government Senior Basic School Playground at Agatti does not affect any cultural, religious, or socially significant structures such as mosques, shrines, or community halls. The land identified for acquisition is limited to open private plots with no recorded presence of sacred sites or cultural landmarks. Survey data confirms that all affected households belong to the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category and follow Islam, yet there is no interference with any religious or traditional practices. The design and location of the playground have been planned to complement the island's communal character and to provide a safe, inclusive recreational facility that fosters youth development, community interaction, and physical well-being. As such, the project is likely to reinforce the island's cohesive social structure while creating a shared civic space that supports intergenerational engagement and gender-inclusive participation.\n\nEnvironmental and Health Considerations in the Social Context:\nThe proposed development of the Government Senior Basic School Playground at Agatti is expected to cause minimal environmental disruption. Since the land is already an open area with limited vegetation and no dense residential structures, construction-related impacts such as dust, noise, and temporary access restrictions will be short-term and manageable. Mitigation measures like dust suppression, limited working hours, designated movement corridors, and proper\n\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 18\n\n**Page 23**\n\nConstruction Of Playground\n\nsignage will be adopted to safeguard community comfort during construction. In the long run, the establishment of a well-planned public playground will have positive effects on community health and well- being. It will provide a dedicated space for physical activity, especially for children and youth, supporting active lifestyles. Additionally, the availability of open, shaded, and clean spaces will improve the social environment, promote stress relief, and encourage greater social interaction across age groups. The project is designed to be inclusive, with features that are accessible to children, women, and elderly residents, thereby contributing to the social and environmental sustainability of the settlement.\n\n7.

Agatti Island, the only island with an operational airport\nand a principal entry point to the archipelago, holds strategic significance as\na growing centre for tourism, administration, and public engagement.\nRecognising the opportunity to enhance both the liveability and vibrancy of\nAgatti, the Administration of Lakshadweep has proposed the development of\na modern City Centre to serve as a public, cultural, and recreational hub for\nresidents and visitors alike.\nThis Social Impact Assessment (SIA) Report has been prepared in accordance\nwith the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition,\nRehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (RFCTLARR Act) and the relevant\nLakshadweep regulations. The report evaluates the potential social\nimplications of acquiring 12,241 square metres of land, including both private\nholdings and government/institutional plots, for the development of the City\nCentre. It identifies the concerns of stakeholders, assesses the socio-economic\ncontext, and suggests mitigation strategies to ensure that the development is\ninclusive, equitable, and sensitive to local needs.\nThe report draws upon a comprehensive review of land records, stakeholder\nconsultations, field surveys, and institutional inputs from the Kavaratti Smart City\nLimited, Public Works Department, and other relevant administrative\nauthorities. It aims to provide actionable recommendations that balance\ninfrastructure development with community needs, environmental sensitivity,\nand socio-cultural values.\nThis document lays the groundwork for a transformative urban initiative that is\nexpected to not only improve public amenities and economic opportunities\nbut also reinforce Agatti's role as a progressive, people-oriented island in the\nLakshadweep group.\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage li\nDevelopment of City Centre\nAcknowledgement\nThe preparation of this Social Impact Assessment (SIA) Report for the\nproposed development of the Agatti City Centre has been made\npossible through the collective efforts, guidance, and cooperation of\nvarious institutions, departments, and individuals committed to the\nsustainable growth of Lakshadweep.\nWe express our sincere gratitude to the District Administration of\nLakshadweep, the Public Works Department (PWD), and the Kavaratti\nSmart City Limited (KSCL) for their consistent support, timely inputs, and\naccess to essential project documentation and land records.

Background of the Project and its details\nThe Union Territory of Lakshadweep comprises 36 small coral islands in the\nArabian Sea, with a total land area of just 32.62 square kilometres, of which\nonly 10 islands are inhabited. As per the 2011 Census, the total population\nis 64,473. The islands are ecologically fragile and geographically isolated,\ndepending heavily on air and sea connectivity via Kochi for most\neconomic, medical, and logistical functions. The Administration of\nLakshadweep has been actively working towards balancing infrastructure\ndevelopment with ecological conservation aiming to improve the quality\nof life for its residents while promoting sustainable, culturally grounded\ntourism across the territory.\nAgatti Island, with a geographical area of 3.22 square kilometres and a\npopulation of 7,566 (Census 2011), is one of the most strategically significant\nislands in the archipelago. Situated at 10°51′ North latitude and 72°11′ East\nlongitude, and located approximately 459 kilometres west of Kochi, Agatti\nserves as the primary gateway to Lakshadweep, being home to the\nterritory's only operational airport. Its picturesque white sand beaches,\nvibrant coral ecosystems, and lagoon-rich geography give it immense\necological and tourism potential. However, the island currently lacks a\nstructured, multifunctional public space where residents and visitors can\nmeaningfully interact, engage in economic activities, and access cultural,\nrecreational, and community services in an organised setting. Recognising\nthis gap, the Administration has proposed the development of a well-\nplanned City Centre at Agatti Island as a flagship initiative under Kavaratti\nSmart City Limited.\nThe proposed City Centre is envisioned as a vibrant public precinct that\nintegrates civic amenities, recreational spaces, and tourism-oriented\nservices in a manner compatible with the island's ecological sensitivity and\nsocio-cultural fabric. The project involves approximately 12,241 square\nmetres of land, which includes 1931 sq.mtr privately owned plots, which is\nto be acquired, and remaining government/institutional parcels. Key\ncomponents of the City Centre include a food kiosk, souvenir and\nhandicraft shops, sky café, wellness spa, children's play areas, maze\ngarden, performance pavilion, water features, viewing decks, smart\nsanitation blocks, locker and changing facilities, seating zones, and secure\nparking areas. Special attention is being given to architectural design,\nlandscape aesthetics, and accessibility features, ensuring that the space\nserves both local residents and tourists. Provisions for digital displays, public\ninformation services, and sustainable features such as rainwater harvesting\nand native vegetation planting have also been incorporated into the plan.\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 1\nDevelopment of City Centre\nCommunity consultations conducted as part of the Social Impact\nAssessment (SIA) process revealed broad-based interest among Agatti\nresidents in the potential benefits of the City Centre project particularly in\nterms of improving local infrastructure, expanding livelihood opportunities,\nand creating a dignified, inclusive public space. At the same time,\nparticipants highlighted the need to protect the island's ecological integrity\nand to avoid disruption to existing services, informal economic activities,\nand commonly used public spaces. These findings have informed the\nrecommendations of the SIA, which emphasise the need for precise and\nminimal land acquisition, timely and transparent compensation for\naffected landowners, and integration of inclusive design and employment-\ngeneration strategies, especially for youth and women. If implemented with\necological sensitivity and sustained community participation, the City\nCentre at Agatti has the potential to become a model of sustainable island\nurbanism-enhancing connectivity, economic vibrancy, and quality of life\nfor Lakshadweep's island communities.\n2. Public Purpose\nThe proposed development of the Agatti City Centre serves an essential\npublic purpose by addressing the pressing need for a well-planned,\ninclusive public space that supports social, economic, and cultural\ndevelopment on Agatti Island. Currently, the island lacks a structured civic\nhub where residents and visitors can engage in recreational, community,\nand livelihood activities. As the primary entry point to Lakshadweep and a\ngrowing tourism destination, Agatti requires integrated infrastructure that\nreflects its ecological sensitivity while enhancing local quality of life.\nThe City Centre aims to fulfil this objective by creating a multifunctional\nspace that includes food kiosks, souvenir shops, children's play areas,\nperformance venues, and wellness facilities designed to generate local\nemployment, promote cultural expression, and support eco-tourism. To\nachieve this without causing undue disruption, the project proposes the\nacquisition of approximately 1931 square metres of land with government\nowned land, identified as the minimum area necessary to accommodate\nplanned facilities and ensure safe, accessible circulation. The proposed site\nincludes both government and private plots, selected to minimise impact\non community spaces and existing services.\nThis approach ensures that the project delivers long-term public benefits\nwhile maintaining respect for land use priorities, ecological considerations,\nand the cultural landscape of Agatti Island.\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 2\nSocial Impact Assessment\n3. Location\nThe proposed site for the Agatti City Centre is situated in the central-western\npart of Agatti Island, at approximate geographic coordinates 10.8666758°N\nand 72.1940073°E. The total area earmarked for the project is 12,241 square\nmetres, which includes a combination of privately owned land and\ngovernment/institutional plots. The site has been strategically selected to\nensure accessibility for both residents and tourists, while supporting the\nintegration of civic, recreational, and tourism-related infrastructure in a\ncohesive and environmentally conscious layout.\nPrepared by APARC PVT.

Alternative sites considered\nThe proposed site for the Agatti City Centre lies within the existing\nadministrative and civic zone of the island, which already functions as the\ninformal city centre. This area includes several government and institutional\nbuildings and serves as the main entry point for all residents and tourists\narriving at Agatti. The project is designed as a redevelopment and\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 4\n10°51'57\"N\n10°52'0\"N\n10°52'3\"N\nSocial Impact Assessment\nmodernisation of this existing functional area to enhance its usability,\naesthetics, and public purpose.\nConsidering an alternative site for the City Centre was found to be neither\nviable nor practical. Identifying and developing a completely new site\nwould involve substantial land acquisition, including privately owned\nparcels, which could lead to legal complexities, social resistance, and\ndelays. In contrast, the current proposal requires only limited additional land\nacquisition, as much of the land is already under government ownership.\nGiven these factors, and to minimise disruption while ensuring continuity of\nservices and accessibility, examining alternative land options was not\nconsidered feasible or appropriate for this project.\n5. Socio-economic condition of affected families\nDemographic and Educational Profile:\nThe affected families belong entirely to the Scheduled Tribe (ST) category\nand follow Islam as their religion. A total of 10 families, comprising 59\nindividuals, were surveyed for this assessment. Of these, 31 were males and\n26 were females, reflecting a slightly male-dominated household\ncomposition.\nThe population demonstrates a high literacy rate of 96%. Educational\nattainment includes 12 individuals with primary education, 34 with\nsecondary education, 8 graduates, and 3 individuals holding technical\ndegrees. All children between the ages of 6 and 14 are reported to be\nenrolled in school, indicating good access to basic education on the island.\nHowever, opportunities for higher education remain limited, often requiring\nstudents to migrate to the mainland, particularly to Kerala, for advanced\nstudies.\nIn terms of age distribution, the affected population includes 9 children\nunder 18 years, 38 adults aged 18 to 55 years, and 12 elderly individuals over\n55 years. Among the total population, 39 individuals are reported to be\nmarried.\nLivelihoods, Occupation and Income Sources:\nThe affected households in the proposed land acquisition area exhibit a\nmixed livelihood pattern, combining informal employment, service-sector\njobs, and traditional subsistence activities. A total of 13 individuals are\nengaged in service-related occupations, including education, healthcare,\ntourism, government services, and private business. Others depend on\nsmall-scale coconut harvesting and fishing, contributing modestly to\nhousehold income.\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 5\nDevelopment of City Centre\nAmong the affected population, 17 individuals are engaged as\nhomemakers, and 14 are currently unemployed, indicating a reliance on\nsingle-income families. The community also includes 7 students and 2\nteachers, reflecting active participation in the education sector.\nNone of the families fall below the poverty line (BPL), and most households\nhave access to alternative agricultural land, ensuring some continuity in\ntheir livelihoods. Basic amenities are present, including pucca houses with\ntoilet facilities, cooking fuel through LPG and/or firewood, and access to\ndrinking water from private wells or the desalination plant supply. This semi-\nsubsistence lifestyle reflects a low-income but relatively stable rural\neconomy, rooted in traditional practices and gradually integrating formal\nemployment opportunities.\nPoverty, Vulnerability, and Access to Welfare Schemes:\nAll the affected families fall under the Above Poverty Line (APL), while food\nsecurity is generally stable, and no household reported skipping meals due\nto poverty. However, some families rely on subsidised food grains and other\ngovernment welfare schemes, such as ICDS, PDS, and mid-day meals.\nAlthough most families are financially stable, the affected households\nexpressed concerns regarding employment opportunities and income\nstability, which could be improved.\nAssets, Housing, and Infrastructure Access:\nAll affected families live in pucca and tiled houses, with no displacement\nrequired due to the project. Basic amenities, including electricity, primary\nhealthcare (PHC and private doctor), and Anganwadi services, are\navailable and accessible. However, the water supply is limited, with piped\ndesalinated water supplied only a few times a week. Households rely on\nprivate wells for non-drinking uses. Sewage infrastructure is inadequate, with\nsoak pits or open drains commonly used. Transport and market access are\nfair within the island, supported by a pucca road network.\nSocial Structure, Community Dynamics, and Aspirations:\nThe island operates under a patriarchal yet socially cohesive system,\ncharacterised by strong kinship ties and high community participation.\nReligious institutions, such as mosques, play a pivotal role in shaping cultural\nlife and influencing decision-making. There is minimal crime, and a peaceful\natmosphere prevails. Women enjoy a fair degree of mobility and freedom,\nthough economic participation remains limited. The community is\naspirational, particularly among the youth, who seek education and skill\ndevelopment to improve their employment prospects. The local economy's\nover-reliance on traditional sectors, such as fishing and government\nservices, is seen as a constraint. Residents expressed hope that infrastructure\nimprovements will lead to diversified livelihood options, especially in\nmedical and paramedical activities, due to this project.\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 16\nSocial Impact Assessment\n6. Social Impacts\nImpact on Land and Livelihoods:\nThe proposed project involves the acquisition of 1,931 square meters of\nprivate land, directly affecting 10 families. Of these, 8 families participated\nin the consultation process, while 2 families, whose assets include 3\nresidential houses and 2 restaurants, did not respond, and therefore\ndetailed socio-economic information on them could not be obtained.\nThe acquisition will also result in the loss of approximately 77 coconut trees\nand 1 small tea stall. Given that coconut is a primary agricultural product\nof Lakshadweep, the removal of these trees has both economic and\ncultural implications. Although cultivation on the affected plots is relatively\nsmall in scale, the impact remains significant and requires adequate\ncompensation under the provisions of the RFCTLARR Act, 2013.\nApart from coconut cultivation, no large-scale agricultural or commercial\nactivity was observed on the acquired land. The tea stall contributes\nmarginally to household income, whereas the two restaurants constitute\nprimary livelihood sources for the affected families. These impacts, along\nwith the loss of residential houses, are significant at the household level and\nnecessitate fair, transparent, and timely compensation, along with\ntargeted livelihood restoration measures.\nOverall, while most affected families do not rely on the acquired land for\ntheir primary sustenance, the loss of houses, restaurants, and coconut trees\nunderscores the need for careful mitigation to avoid hardship and ensure\nequitable rehabilitation.\nImpact on Infrastructure and Public Utilities:\nThe project involves the demolition and reorganisation of certain outdated\ngovernment buildings within the central administrative zone of Agatti Island.\nHowever, this does not cause any adverse impact on essential\ninfrastructure. Critical services such as roads, electricity, water supply,\ndrainage, and communications will remain fully functional during all project\nphases. The area proposed for acquisition excludes vital utility installations,\nand any temporary adjustments will be carefully coordinated to avoid\ndisruption. In the long term, the redevelopment is expected to improve\ninfrastructure efficiency by integrating public services into a modern and\naccessible civic space.\nImpact on Vulnerable Groups and Social Equity\nThe project does not involve the displacement of residents or adversely\naffect any vulnerable households, including women-headed families,\nelderly persons, or persons with disabilities. All affected families belong to\nthe Scheduled Tribe (ST) category and follow Islam, yet none fall below the\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 17\nDevelopment of City Centre\npoverty line or show signs of severe socio-economic vulnerability. The land\nidentified for acquisition consists primarily of government-owned plots and\nunderutilised institutional spaces, along with a limited portion of private\nland. There is no evidence of landlessness, nor are any of the households\ncritically dependent on common property resources within the proposed\nsite. Rather than posing risks, the project is expected to promote social\ninclusion by improving access to well-designed public spaces and\nlivelihood opportunities. Emphasis has been placed on universal\naccessibility, gender-sensitive infrastructure, and equitable use of civic\nspace, with specific design features that support participation by youth,\nwomen, and local artisans. Overall, the project is anticipated to advance\nsocial equity and community integration.\nImpact on Cultural and Social Fabric:\nThe City Centre development has been carefully aligned to respect the\ncultural and social integrity of Agatti Island. No cultural or religious structures\nsuch as mosques, shrines, or community-specific sites are affected by the\nproject. The design ensures minimal interference with community customs,\ntraditional land use, and social norms, thereby preserving the island's\ncohesive and harmonious social fabric. Furthermore, the creation of\ninclusive public spaces and amenities is expected to enhance social\nengagement, support women's mobility and participation in public life, and\ncontribute positively to cultural expression and social equity.\nEnvironmental and Health Considerations in the Social Context:\nWhile the project may cause minor, short-term disruptions during\nconstruction such as dust generation, noise, and restricted pedestrian\nmovement near the site these impacts are expected to be temporary and\nmanageable. Mitigation strategies such as restricted work hours, dust\nsuppression measures, noise control, and adequate public signage will be\nimplemented to minimise inconvenience to the community.\nIn the long term, the development of the Agatti City Centre is anticipated\nto yield substantial benefits for the health and well-being of the local\npopulation. The inclusion of open public spaces, shaded seating areas,\nimproved walkability, clean sanitation facilities, and safe drinking water\npoints will enhance the quality of the public realm. By promoting active\nlifestyles, social interaction, and hygienic surroundings, the City Centre will\ncontribute to a healthier urban environment. Furthermore, thoughtful\nlandscape design, integration of green features, and universal accessibility\nare expected to improve the island's overall climate resilience and support\ninclusive community development.\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 18\nSocial Impact Assessment\n7. Impact on Physical Resources\nLand, Soil, and Vegetation:\nThe land designated for the development of the Agatti City Centre is\nlocated on the western side of Agatti Island. It comprises sandy coastal\nterrain with approximately 77 coconut trees, along with minor patches of\ncoastal vegetation and open plots. The soil in the area is characterized by\nhigh salinity and low fertility, limiting the potential for systematic farming or\nirrigation-based agriculture.\nWhile seasonal cropping, paddy, or vegetable cultivation is absent,\ncoconut remains the principal form of cultivation in the notified plots,\nconsistent with the wider agricultural profile of the Lakshadweep islands. The\nproposed acquisition will therefore involve the removal of coconut trees\nand small areas of coastal vegetation, which represent both livelihood and\necological value.\nThese impacts are localized and will be mitigated through compensatory\nmeasures, including the valuation of lost coconut trees and provision for\nreplacement plantation on nearby public or community lands. Importantly,\nthe site does not encompass any forest land, grazing areas, or legally\nprotected zones, ensuring that the broader ecological balance of the\nisland remains intact.\nImpact on Common Property Resources and Natural Systems:\nThe Agatti City Centre project does not affect any common property\nresources such as public wells, grazing lands, religious sites, or other\nculturally significant community assets. The existing surrounding open areas\nand public access zones will remain available to the community, with no\nrestrictions anticipated during or after construction. Although the project\nsite is located inland and away from sensitive marine ecosystems such as\nlagoons, coral reefs, or coastal wetlands precautionary measures will be\nadopted during construction to prevent adverse environmental impacts."

While the notification mentions Land\nParcel 1285/2F, the corresponding land record extract, site drawing, and\nownership details pertain to Land Parcel 1285/2E. Both parcels refer to\nthe same location and area, measuring 930 sq. m. During the socio-\neconomic survey, the landowner of 1285/2E confirmed awareness of the\nproposed land acquisition for the LPG Godown. This clarification is made\nto ensure consistency and accuracy in land referencing throughout the\nreport.\nOut of the two families (comprising a total of 21 members) identified as\ndirectly affected in the Agatti LPG Godown project, both families either\nresponded partially or refused to answer the socio-economic\nquestionnaire in detail. As a result, the socio-economic information\npresented is limited and may not accurately represent the full profile of\nthe affected households.\nPrepared by APARC PVT.

Background of the Project and its details\nThe Union Territory of Lakshadweep comprises 36 small coral islands in the\nArabian Sea with a total land area of just 32.62 sq. km, of which only 10\nislands are inhabited. As per the 2011 Census, the total population is 64,473.\nThe islands are ecologically sensitive and geographically isolated, relying\non air and sea connectivity primarily via Cochin. The administration seeks to\nbalance infrastructure development with ecological conservation to\nenhance residents' quality of life and support sustainable tourism across the\nterritory.\nThe land acquisition for the construction of the LPG Godown is an important\nlandmark initiative of the Lakshadweep Administration to improve the\ninfrastructure standards of Agatti Island in Lakshadweep. The project aims\nto provide basic and essential living standards to the local communities on\nthe island. The project can cater to two different and major requirements\nfor the local community.\nThe two major requirements that the LPG Godown project aims to fulfil for\nthe local community of Agatti Island are: first, to ensure a safe and reliable\nsupply of LPG by establishing a centralized storage and distribution system,\nreducing dependency on irregular mainland shipments; and second, to\nimprove basic living standards by providing clean cooking fuel, enhancing\npublic health, and strengthening the island's preparedness during\nemergencies. The Lakshadweep Administration wants to extend the same\nfacility and its service to other islands also. In such a way, the LPG Godown\nat Agatti will be one of the major milestones that the Administration ensures\nfor the local communities.\nThis project supports the public purpose by ensuring energy security through\nthe safe and reliable supply of LPG, improving public health by promoting\nthe use of clean cooking fuel, creating local employment opportunities,\nand strengthening the island's infrastructure to enhance the overall quality\nof life for Agatti Island residents. The SIA concludes that the project is socially\ndesirable and necessary, with appropriate mitigation measures planned for\nminor impacts like the loss of coconut trees.\n2. Public Purpose\nThe project is classified as serving a public purpose under the RFCTLARR Act,\n2013, as it addresses essential infrastructure needs, energy security, and\npublic health. It supports safe fuel storage and distribution for Agatti's\npopulation, reducing reliance on inconsistent mainland shipments.\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 1\nConstruction of LPG Godown\n3. Location\nThe location of the proposed project is at Agatti Island, which is located at\n10.866308 latitude and 72.194712 longitude, 459 km away from Kochi. The\nisland has a land area of 3.22 sq. km. It has a lagoon of about 24.84 sq. km.\nLegend\nCoconut Trees\nLPG Godown Agatti Land\n1285/2E\n*\n1285/2D\nSource: Esri, Maxar, Earthstar Geographics, and the GIS User Community\nFigure 1 Location of Agatti Island\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 2\nSocial Impact Assessment\n4. Alternative sites considered\nFrom the study and assessment of various aspects like geographic location,\ntype of project, suitable environment, etc., it is found that this is the best site\nas compared to any other on the Agatti island.\n5. Socio-economic condition of affected families\nThere are only two families affected due to this acquisition proceeding.\nNone of the families is living at this place. So, their livelihood is unaffected.\nThis land was taken by the UT administration on lease from one family in\npast. They have no objection if the Government acquire this land and pays\nthem proper compensation as per the law and market value.\n6. Social Impacts\nImpact on Land and Livelihoods:\nThe project involves the acquisition of 2,880 square meters of private land,\nimpacting only two families in terms of land ownership but not resulting in\nany physical displacement. The land being acquired is not used for a\nprimary livelihood base, as no agricultural activities or commercial\nenterprises exist on the proposed plots. There are 76 coconut trees in both\nplots, along with two other trees and a dug well. The loss is limited and\ncompensable. Moreover, since one of the affected families depends on\nthe land for their primary sustenance, the risk of impoverishment or\ndisruption in livelihood is minimal and compensable.\nImpact on Infrastructure and Public Utilities:\nThe LPG Godown will positively impact infrastructure and public utilities by\nenhancing the island's energy infrastructure, providing a centralised and\nregulated facility for LPG storage and distribution, and ensuring\nuninterrupted fuel availability for households, businesses, and public\ninstitutions. It will also reduce reliance on makeshift or unsafe storage\npractices, thereby improving public safety and operational efficiency\nwithout disrupting existing utilities like roads, water supply, health centres, or\nschools.\nEnvironmental and Health Considerations in the Social Context:\nIn the social context, the LPG Godown project presents minimal\nenvironmental impact as the land is non-agricultural with sparse\nvegetation, and no ecologically sensitive areas are disturbed. Health\nconsiderations are largely positive, while temporary construction-phase\neffects like dust and noise may occur, they are manageable through\nmitigation measures. In the long term, the project will improve public health\nby promoting the use of clean cooking fuel, reducing indoor air pollution,\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 3\nConstruction of LPG Godown\nand supporting better sanitation through integrated waste and drainage\nsystems.\n7. Impact on Physical Resources\nIn terms of impact on physical resources, the project involves the acquisition\nof sandy, non-agricultural land with scattered coconut trees, resulting in\nminimal disruption to soil or vegetation. No common property resources,\nsuch as water bodies, grazing lands, or religious sites, are affected. The land\nis suitable for development, and the construction of the LPG Godown will\nnot compromise the island's natural systems or lead to resource depletion,\nmaking the impact on physical resources limited and manageable\n8. Impact on Private Assets, Public Services and Utilities\nIn terms of impact on private assets, public services, and utilities, the project\ndoes not involve the displacement of any residential structures, nor does it\naffect public infrastructure such as schools, health centres, roads, or water\npipelines. The only private assets impacted are 76 coconut trees, two other\ntrees, and one well, which are compensable. Overall, essential public\nservices and utilities will remain unaffected, and the project is expected to\nenhance infrastructure without causing any disruption to existing facilities.\n9. Health Impacts\nIn terms of health impacts, the project poses minor, temporary risks during\nthe construction phase, such as dust, noise, and restricted access, which\ncan be effectively managed through mitigation measures like dust\nsuppression, noise control, and work-hour limitations. In the long term, the\nLPG Godown will have positive health outcomes by enabling access to\nclean cooking fuel, thereby reducing indoor air pollution, improving\nrespiratory health, and enhancing hygiene through better waste\nmanagement and drainage infrastructure.\n10. Impact on cultures, social cohesion, and gender\nIn terms of impact on cultures, social cohesion, and gender, the project\nrespects the island's cultural fabric as it does not disturb any religious or\nheritage sites. It is expected to enhance social cohesion by providing safe,\naccessible infrastructure that supports community interaction and\ncollective use. The project also promotes gender inclusion by creating\nemployment opportunities for women and enabling greater participation\nof women and youth in public and economic spaces, particularly through\nthe prioritisation of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) during implementation and\noperation.\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 4\nSocial Impact Assessment\n11. Mitigation Measures\nThis land of 2880 sq.m was earlier taken on lease by the UT administration,\nand the existing landowners have some dispute regarding the lease\namount. However, they have no objection if the Government acquire this\nland for the LPG Godown centre project by following proper law. Therefore,\nall affected landowners will be compensated as per the RFCTLARR Act,\n2013, including separate compensation for 76 coconut trees, two other\ntrees, one dug well and minor assets. However, no residential displacement\nis expected, but a grievance redressal mechanism will be established to\nhandle compensation-related concerns. Environmentally, the project will\nrestore lost green cover through replantation drives using native species,\nincluding coconut trees, ideally in a 5:1 ratio, and integrate eco-sensitive\nlandscaping in the final design.\nThe second component addresses cultural sensitivity and construction-\nphase disturbances. Since at the site some structure is already existing,\nconstruction activities will be very less, but it will be regulated to minimise\ndust, noise, and disruptions, with work limited to daytime hours and\npedestrian pathways maintained for residents. Solid waste management\nsystems, stormwater drainage, and eco-friendly public toilets will be\ninstalled as part of the project's commitment to sustainable infrastructure\nand public health. Solar lighting and safety signage will ensure accessibility\nand cleanliness of public spaces.\nThe third component addresses the plan emphasises inclusive economic\ndevelopment and social safeguards. Project Affected Families (PAFs),\nparticularly women, youth, and members of SHGs, will receive priority for\nemployment in construction, maintenance, and recreational hall-linked\nservices.\n12. Assessment of Social Costs& Benefits\nIn the assessment of social costs and benefits, the project presents minimal\nsocial costs, limited to the acquisition of 2,880 sq. m of land from two\nfamilies, the removal of 76 coconut trees, two other trees, and one well, as\nwell as temporary construction-related inconveniences such as dust, noise,\nand restricted access. These impacts are localised, compensable, and\nmanageable through planned mitigation measures. In contrast, the project\noffers substantial long-term social benefits, including improved energy\nsecurity, enhanced public safety, local employment generation, reduced\ndependence on irregular fuel supply, and better health outcomes. Overall,\nthe benefits far outweigh the costs, making the project socially equitable\nand economically justified.\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 5\nConstruction of LPG Godown\n13. Public Hearing\nAs part of the Social Impact Assessment (SIA) process for the proposed\nConstruction of LPG Godown at Agatti Island, a Public Hearing was\nconducted on 3rd October 2025 at 3:00 PM at the District Collector's Hall,\nAgatti Island. The hearing was organized by the Social Impact Assessment\n& Consent Society, Union Territory of Lakshadweep, in compliance with the\nprovisions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land\nAcquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (RFCTLARR Act,\n2013). Wide publicity was given through local newspapers, public notices,\nand announcements to ensure maximum participation. Officials from the\nDepartment of Land Revenue, Department of Food and Supplies, Public\nWorks Department (PWD), Forest Department, and Agatti Panchayat\nOffice, along with members of the SIA Team, attended the meeting.\nDuring the hearing, participants raised several concerns and objections\nrelated to the proposed land acquisition. Landowners emphasized that the\nland had been leased to the Government for 35 years and expressed\nunwillingness to transfer ownership through acquisition, requesting\ncontinuation under the lease model. Issues related to inadequate\ncompensation, declining land values, and protection of Scheduled Tribe\nland rights were also raised. Some participants suggested adopting a\npipeline-based LPG distribution system instead of a storage godown, citing\nspace constraints and safety considerations. Officials from the concerned\ndepartments responded to the queries and provided clarifications\nregarding compensation, safety measures, and project requirements.\nWhile clarifications were provided by the officials and SIA Team, several\nparticipants reiterated their preference for the lease arrangement and\nrequested fair valuation in line with the Lakshadweep Land Acquisition Act,\n1970 and the RFCTLARR Act, 2013. The proceedings were conducted\ntransparently, ensuring that all stakeholders had the opportunity to express\ntheir views. The meeting concluded with a vote of thanks by Mr. Asish Manoj\nP., Member of the SIA Team, and the entire session was documented\nthrough HD video recording and photographs. The written representations\nsubmitted during the hearing have been compiled and attached as\nAnnexure-8, and the list of participants is enclosed as Annexure-7.\n14. Final Conclusions and Recommendations\nThe proposed construction of LPG Godown is socially and culturally\nbeneficial, environmentally feasible, and environmentally non-disruptive\nwith the long-term development goals of the Union Territory of\nLakshadweep. The project serves a public purpose, aiming to be necessary\nfor public infrastructure development and provide livelihood opportunities\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 16\nSocial Impact Assessment\nto the local community. Importantly, the land acquisition of 2880 sq. meters\ninvolves no physical displacement of families and does not disrupt any\nessential public or private service. The local population, while expressing\nemotional and cultural attachment to the land, has largely supported the\ndevelopment during consultations, provided their concerns are respected\nand addressed.\nPrepared by APARC PVT.
