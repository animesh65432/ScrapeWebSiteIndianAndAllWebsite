While the notification mentions Land\nParcel 1285/2F, the corresponding land record extract, site drawing, and\nownership details pertain to Land Parcel 1285/2E. Both parcels refer to\nthe same location and area, measuring 930 sq. m. During the socio-\neconomic survey, the landowner of 1285/2E confirmed awareness of the\nproposed land acquisition for the LPG Godown. This clarification is made\nto ensure consistency and accuracy in land referencing throughout the\nreport.\n\nOut of the two families (comprising a total of 21 members) identified as\ndirectly affected in the Agatti LPG Godown project, both families either\nresponded partially or refused to answer the socio-economic\nquestionnaire in detail. As a result, the socio-economic information\npresented is limited and may not accurately represent the full profile of\nthe affected households.\nPrepared by APARC PVT.

Background of the Project and its details\nThe Union Territory of Lakshadweep comprises 36 small coral islands in the\nArabian Sea with a total land area of just 32.62 sq. km, of which only 10\nislands are inhabited. As per the 2011 Census, the total population is 64,473.\nThe islands are ecologically sensitive and geographically isolated, relying\non air and sea connectivity primarily via Cochin. The administration seeks to\nbalance infrastructure development with ecological conservation to\nenhance residents' quality of life and support sustainable tourism across the\nterritory.\n\nThe land acquisition for the construction of the LPG Godown is an important\nlandmark initiative of the Lakshadweep Administration to improve the\ninfrastructure standards of Agatti Island in Lakshadweep. The project aims\nto provide basic and essential living standards to the local communities on\nthe island. The project can cater to two different and major requirements\nfor the local community.\n\nThe two major requirements that the LPG Godown project aims to fulfil for\nthe local community of Agatti Island are: first, to ensure a safe and reliable\nsupply of LPG by establishing a centralized storage and distribution system,\nreducing dependency on irregular mainland shipments; and second, to\nimprove basic living standards by providing clean cooking fuel, enhancing\npublic health, and strengthening the island's preparedness during\nemergencies. The Lakshadweep Administration wants to extend the same\nfacility and its service to other islands also. In such a way, the LPG Godown\nat Agatti will be one of the major milestones that the Administration ensures\nfor the local communities.\n\nThis project supports the public purpose by ensuring energy security through\nthe safe and reliable supply of LPG, improving public health by promoting\nthe use of clean cooking fuel, creating local employment opportunities,\nand strengthening the island's infrastructure to enhance the overall quality\nof life for Agatti Island residents. The SIA concludes that the project is socially\ndesirable and necessary, with appropriate mitigation measures planned for\nminor impacts like the loss of coconut trees.\n2. Public Purpose\nThe project is classified as serving a public purpose under the RFCTLARR Act,\n2013, as it addresses essential infrastructure needs, energy security, and\npublic health. It supports safe fuel storage and distribution for Agatti's\npopulation, reducing reliance on inconsistent mainland shipments.\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 1\n\nConstruction of LPG Godown\n3. Location\nThe location of the proposed project is at Agatti Island, which is located at\n10.866308 latitude and 72.194712 longitude, 459 km away from Kochi. The\nisland has a land area of 3.22 sq. km. It has a lagoon of about 24.84 sq. km.\nLegend\nCoconut Trees\nLPG Godown Agatti Land\n1285/2E\n*\n1285/2D\nSource: Esri, Maxar, Earthstar Geographics, and the GIS User Community\nFigure 1 Location of Agatti Island\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 2\n\nSocial Impact Assessment\n4. Alternative sites considered\nFrom the study and assessment of various aspects like geographic location,\ntype of project, suitable environment, etc., it is found that this is the best site\nas compared to any other on the Agatti island.\n5. Socio-economic condition of affected families\nThere are only two families affected due to this acquisition proceeding.\nNone of the families is living at this place. So, their livelihood is unaffected.\nThis land was taken by the UT administration on lease from one family in\npast. They have no objection if the Government acquire this land and pays\nthem proper compensation as per the law and market value.\n6. Social Impacts\nImpact on Land and Livelihoods:\nThe project involves the acquisition of 2,880 square meters of private land,\nimpacting only two families in terms of land ownership but not resulting in\nany physical displacement. The land being acquired is not used for a\nprimary livelihood base, as no agricultural activities or commercial\nenterprises exist on the proposed plots. There are 76 coconut trees in both\nplots, along with two other trees and a dug well. The loss is limited and\ncompensable. Moreover, since one of the affected families depends on\nthe land for their primary sustenance, the risk of impoverishment or\ndisruption in livelihood is minimal and compensable.\nImpact on Infrastructure and Public Utilities:\nThe LPG Godown will positively impact infrastructure and public utilities by\nenhancing the island's energy infrastructure, providing a centralised and\nregulated facility for LPG storage and distribution, and ensuring\nuninterrupted fuel availability for households, businesses, and public\ninstitutions. It will also reduce reliance on makeshift or unsafe storage\npractices, thereby improving public safety and operational efficiency\nwithout disrupting existing utilities like roads, water supply, health centres, or\nschools.\nEnvironmental and Health Considerations in the Social Context:\nIn the social context, the LPG Godown project presents minimal\nenvironmental impact as the land is non-agricultural with sparse\nvegetation, and no ecologically sensitive areas are disturbed. Health\nconsiderations are largely positive, while temporary construction-phase\neffects like dust and noise may occur, they are manageable through\nmitigation measures. In the long term, the project will improve public health\nby promoting the use of clean cooking fuel, reducing indoor air pollution,\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 3\n\nConstruction of LPG Godown\nand supporting better sanitation through integrated waste and drainage\nsystems.\n7. Impact on Physical Resources\nIn terms of impact on physical resources, the project involves the acquisition\nof sandy, non-agricultural land with scattered coconut trees, resulting in\nminimal disruption to soil or vegetation. No common property resources,\nsuch as water bodies, grazing lands, or religious sites, are affected. The land\nis suitable for development, and the construction of the LPG Godown will\nnot compromise the island's natural systems or lead to resource depletion,\nmaking the impact on physical resources limited and manageable\n8. Impact on Private Assets, Public Services and Utilities\nIn terms of impact on private assets, public services, and utilities, the project\ndoes not involve the displacement of any residential structures, nor does it\naffect public infrastructure such as schools, health centres, roads, or water\npipelines. The only private assets impacted are 76 coconut trees, two other\ntrees, and one well, which are compensable. Overall, essential public\nservices and utilities will remain unaffected, and the project is expected to\nenhance infrastructure without causing any disruption to existing facilities.\n9. Health Impacts\nIn terms of health impacts, the project poses minor, temporary risks during\nthe construction phase, such as dust, noise, and restricted access, which\ncan be effectively managed through mitigation measures like dust\nsuppression, noise control, and work-hour limitations. In the long term, the\nLPG Godown will have positive health outcomes by enabling access to\nclean cooking fuel, thereby reducing indoor air pollution, improving\nrespiratory health, and enhancing hygiene through better waste\nmanagement and drainage infrastructure.\n10. Impact on cultures, social cohesion, and gender\nIn terms of impact on cultures, social cohesion, and gender, the project\nrespects the island's cultural fabric as it does not disturb any religious or\nheritage sites. It is expected to enhance social cohesion by providing safe,\naccessible infrastructure that supports community interaction and\ncollective use. The project also promotes gender inclusion by creating\nemployment opportunities for women and enabling greater participation\nof women and youth in public and economic spaces, particularly through\nthe prioritisation of Self-Help Groups (SHGs) during implementation and\noperation.\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 4\n\nSocial Impact Assessment\n11. Mitigation Measures\nThis land of 2880 sq.m was earlier taken on lease by the UT administration,\nand the existing landowners have some dispute regarding the lease\namount. However, they have no objection if the Government acquire this\nland for the LPG Godown centre project by following proper law. Therefore,\nall affected landowners will be compensated as per the RFCTLARR Act,\n2013, including separate compensation for 76 coconut trees, two other\ntrees, one dug well and minor assets. However, no residential displacement\nis expected, but a grievance redressal mechanism will be established to\nhandle compensation-related concerns. Environmentally, the project will\nrestore lost green cover through replantation drives using native species,\nincluding coconut trees, ideally in a 5:1 ratio, and integrate eco-sensitive\nlandscaping in the final design.\n\nThe second component addresses cultural sensitivity and construction-\nphase disturbances. Since at the site some structure is already existing,\nconstruction activities will be very less, but it will be regulated to minimise\ndust, noise, and disruptions, with work limited to daytime hours and\npedestrian pathways maintained for residents. Solid waste management\nsystems, stormwater drainage, and eco-friendly public toilets will be\ninstalled as part of the project's commitment to sustainable infrastructure\nand public health. Solar lighting and safety signage will ensure accessibility\nand cleanliness of public spaces.\n\nThe third component addresses the plan emphasises inclusive economic\ndevelopment and social safeguards. Project Affected Families (PAFs),\nparticularly women, youth, and members of SHGs, will receive priority for\nemployment in construction, maintenance, and recreational hall-linked\nservices.\n12. Assessment of Social Costs& Benefits\nIn the assessment of social costs and benefits, the project presents minimal\nsocial costs, limited to the acquisition of 2,880 sq. m of land from two\nfamilies, the removal of 76 coconut trees, two other trees, and one well, as\nwell as temporary construction-related inconveniences such as dust, noise,\nand restricted access. These impacts are localised, compensable, and\nmanageable through planned mitigation measures. In contrast, the project\noffers substantial long-term social benefits, including improved energy\nsecurity, enhanced public safety, local employment generation, reduced\ndependence on irregular fuel supply, and better health outcomes. Overall,\nthe benefits far outweigh the costs, making the project socially equitable\nand economically justified.\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 5\n\nConstruction of LPG Godown\n13. Public Hearing\nAs part of the Social Impact Assessment (SIA) process for the proposed\nConstruction of LPG Godown at Agatti Island, a Public Hearing was\nconducted on 3rd October 2025 at 3:00 PM at the District Collector's Hall,\nAgatti Island. The hearing was organized by the Social Impact Assessment\n& Consent Society, Union Territory of Lakshadweep, in compliance with the\nprovisions of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land\nAcquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 (RFCTLARR Act,\n2013). Wide publicity was given through local newspapers, public notices,\nand announcements to ensure maximum participation. Officials from the\nDepartment of Land Revenue, Department of Food and Supplies, Public\nWorks Department (PWD), Forest Department, and Agatti Panchayat\nOffice, along with members of the SIA Team, attended the meeting.\n\nDuring the hearing, participants raised several concerns and objections\nrelated to the proposed land acquisition. Landowners emphasized that the\nland had been leased to the Government for 35 years and expressed\nunwillingness to transfer ownership through acquisition, requesting\ncontinuation under the lease model. Issues related to inadequate\ncompensation, declining land values, and protection of Scheduled Tribe\nland rights were also raised. Some participants suggested adopting a\npipeline-based LPG distribution system instead of a storage godown, citing\nspace constraints and safety considerations. Officials from the concerned\ndepartments responded to the queries and provided clarifications\nregarding compensation, safety measures, and project requirements.\n\nWhile clarifications were provided by the officials and SIA Team, several\nparticipants reiterated their preference for the lease arrangement and\nrequested fair valuation in line with the Lakshadweep Land Acquisition Act,\n1970 and the RFCTLARR Act, 2013. The proceedings were conducted\ntransparently, ensuring that all stakeholders had the opportunity to express\ntheir views. The meeting concluded with a vote of thanks by Mr. Asish Manoj\nP., Member of the SIA Team, and the entire session was documented\nthrough HD video recording and photographs. The written representations\nsubmitted during the hearing have been compiled and attached as\nAnnexure-8, and the list of participants is enclosed as Annexure-7.\n14. Final Conclusions and Recommendations\nThe proposed construction of LPG Godown is socially and culturally\nbeneficial, environmentally feasible, and environmentally non-disruptive\nwith the long-term development goals of the Union Territory of\nLakshadweep. The project serves a public purpose, aiming to be necessary\nfor public infrastructure development and provide livelihood opportunities\nPrepared by APARC PVT. LTD.\nPage 16\n\nSocial Impact Assessment\nto the local community. Importantly, the land acquisition of 2880 sq. meters\ninvolves no physical displacement of families and does not disrupt any\nessential public or private service. The local population, while expressing\nemotional and cultural attachment to the land, has largely supported the\ndevelopment during consultations, provided their concerns are respected\nand addressed.\nPrepared by APARC PVT.
